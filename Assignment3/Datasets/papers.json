NFTs are universally observed in aging, occurring with or without the concomitant accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (A\u03b2) in plaques that typifies Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common tauopathy. Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is an A\u03b2-independent process that affects the medial temporal lobe in both cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Determinants of symptomology in subjects with PART are poorly understood and require clinicopathologic correlation; however, classical approaches to staging tau pathology have limited quantitative reproducibility. As such, there is a critical need for unbiased methods to quantitatively analyze tau pathology on the histological level. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate highly accurate and precise computer vision assessments of digitized pathology slides, yielding novel histology metrics at scale. Here, we performed a retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort (n\u2009=\u2009706) of human post-mortem brain tissues from normal and cognitively impaired elderly individuals with mild or no A\u03b2 plaques (average age of death of 83.1\u00a0yr, range 55-110). We utilized a CNN trained to segment NFTs on hippocampus sections immunohistochemically stained with antisera recognizing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which yielded metrics of regional NFT counts, NFT positive pixel density, as well as a novel graph-theory based metric measuring the spatial distribution of NFTs. We found that several AI-derived NFT metrics significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment in both the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortex (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). When controlling for age, AI-derived NFT counts still significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment (p\u2009=\u20090.04 in the entorhinal cortex; p\u2009=\u20090.04 overall). In contrast, Braak stage did not predict cognitive impairment in either age-adjusted or unadjusted models.

Here we defined the binding affinity of the fluorescent amyloid probes BSB and MCAAD to disease-relevant protein aggregates, and combined the two probes to examine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mouse and human brain samples. Coupled with quantitative spectral phasor analysis, the dual-probe staining approach revealed remarkable heterogeneity of protein aggregates across the samples. Distinct emission spectra were consistent with certain types of deposits present in the mouse and human brain sections. The sensitivity of this staining, imaging and analysis approach outperformed conventional immunohistochemistry with the detected spectral differences between the greater parenchyma of cognitively normal and AD cases indicating a subtle yet widespread proteopathy associated with disease.

As reported in our previous study, the combination of Alpinia Oxyphylla Fructus and Schisandra Chinensis Fructus (AS) had a neuroprotective effect. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-AD effect of AS and the mechanism by which AS reduces the neurotoxic effect of Al. Firstly, we used aluminium-maltol (Al(mal)3) to construct a mouse model of AD and performed oral administration of AS, followed by behavioral experiments, and we collected the mouse brain for immunohistochemistry analysis. In vivo results showed that AS significantly improved Al-induced cognitive decline in mice, and reduced the levels of A\u03b21-42 and P-Tau in the brain, which further proved the anti-AD effect of AS. Then, in order to explore the mechanism by which AS reduced A\u03b21-42, Al-induced PC12 cells were used for the in vitro experiments. Compared with other ratios, the ratio of Alpinia Oxyphylla Fructus: Schisandra Chinensis Fructus (AO:SC) = 1:2 could better improve the cell viability and reduce the A\u03b21-42 level. Accroding to western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, AS ameliorated the pathological process by downregulating the expression of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), rather than by reducing the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Tau. These results suggest that AS ameliorated Al-induced AD by affecting the expression of BACE1 and reducing the level of A\u03b21-42, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect.

Moreover, the modification of the scaffolds revealed the adaptation of the orientation in the binding pocket and additional important interactions from the modified scaffold, such as H-bond and H-\u03c0 interactions to Asp74, Tyr124 and Tyr337. In addition, the HOMO-LUMO prediction indicated the binding interaction by considering the electron transfer between the hybrid donepezils and key residues, such as Trp86 and Trp286. The bioavailability, drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics predictions confirmed the suitability of the hybrid donepezils for AD drug development. Most of the selected hybrid donepezils revealed good bioavailability, drug-likeness properties and pharmacokinetics; however, some need improved pharmacokinetic properties.

In the current study, we explored the cytotoxic signal transduction pathway in 42-amino-acid A\u03b2 (A\u03b242)-treated HeLa cells in relation to the increase in CCC. The increase in CCC was prominent in cells treated twice with oligomeric A\u03b242. We previously showed that double treatment also promoted A\u03b2-induced lamin fragmentation (AILF), which appears to be mediated by cathepsin L. Apoptotic caspase activation was a downstream event of AILF. The Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM suppressed cell death, cathepsin L activation, AILF, and caspase activation in A\u03b2-treated cells. These results indicate that A\u03b242 induces an increase in CCC, which is an event upstream of the cytotoxic processes. The products of AILF are different from those produced by other cell death-inducing agents, such as staurosporine, which induces caspase-6-mediated lamin fragmentation (CMLF). CMLF was unaffected by BAPTA-AM and was not detected in cells treated with A\u03b242, indicating that A\u03b242 peptide induced a specific cytotoxic pathway involving AILF via increased CCC.

LPSs have been abundantly detected in aged human brain by multiple independent research investigators, and an increased abundance of LPSs around and within Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected neurons has been found. Microbiome-generated LPSs and other endotoxins cross GI-tract biophysiological barriers into the systemic circulation and across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, a pathological process that increases during aging and in vascular disorders, including 'leaky gut syndrome'. Further evidence indicates that LPSs up-regulate pro-inflammatory transcription factor complex NF-kB (p50/p65) and subsequently a set of NF-kB-sensitive microRNAs, including miRNA-30b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155. These up-regulated miRNAs in turn down-regulate a family of neurodegeneration-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, including the mRNA encoding the neuron-specific neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein. While NF-L has been reported to be up-regulated in peripheral biofluids in AD and other progressive and lethal pro-inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders, NF-L is significantly down-regulated within neocortical neurons, and this may account for neuronal atrophy, loss of axonal caliber and alterations in neuronal cell shape, modified synaptic architecture and network deficits in neuronal signaling capacity.

To advance our knowledge about the role of GIIA in AD, we studied the effect of rat GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria and compared it with that of the Atx. We produced recombinant rat GIIA (rGIIA) and its enzymatically inactive mutant, rGIIA(D49S), and demonstrated that they interact with the subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (CCOX-II) as Atx. rGIIA and rGIIA(D49S) bound to this essential constituent of the respiratory chain complex with an approximately 100-fold lower affinity than Atx; nevertheless, both rGIIA molecules potently inhibited the CCOX activity in the isolated rat mitochondria. Like Atx, rGIIA was able to reach the mitochondria in the PC12 cells from the extracellular space, independent of its enzymatic activity. Consistently, the inhibition of the CCOX activity in the intact PC12 cells and in the rat's brain tissue sections was clearly demonstrated using rGIIA(D49S). Our results show that the effects of mammalian and snake venom \u03b2-neurotoxic GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria have similar molecular backgrounds.

Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have established that E2F4 can also play a relevant role in cell and tissue homeostasis, as well as tissue regeneration. For these non-canonical functions, E2F4 can also act in the cytoplasm, where it is able to interact with many homeostatic and synaptic regulators. Since E2F4 is expressed in the nervous system, it may fulfill a crucial role in brain function and homeostasis, being a promising multifactorial target for neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging. The regulation of E2F4 is complex, as it can be chemically modified through acetylation, from which we present evidence in the brain, as well as methylation, and phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of E2F4 within a conserved threonine motif induces cell cycle re-entry in neurons, while a dominant negative form of E2F4 (E2F4DN), in which the conserved threonines have been substituted by alanines, has been shown to act as a multifactorial therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We generated transgenic mice neuronally expressing E2F4DN. We have recently shown using this mouse strain that expression of E2F4DN in 5xFAD mice, a known murine model of AD, improved cognitive function, reduced neuronal tetraploidization, and induced a transcriptional program consistent with modulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide proteostasis and brain homeostasis recovery. 5xFAD/E2F4DN mice also showed reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 3-6 months of age.

In that sense, natural compounds are an outstanding source of potential drug leads. Here, we combine different experimental models, cell-based approaches, neuronal culture assays, and rodent behavior tests with Xenopus laevis phenotypic analysis to characterize quercitrin, a natural compound, as a novel Wnt signaling potentiator. We find that quercitrin potentiates the signaling in a concentration-dependent manner and increases the occurrence of the Xenopus secondary axis phenotype mediated by Xwnt8 injection. Using a GSK3 biosensor, we describe that quercitrin impairs GSK3 activity and increases phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2 S9 levels. Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor downstream of GSK3, impairs the quercitrin-mediated effect. Next, we show that quercitrin potentiates the Wnt3a-synaptogenic effect in hippocampal neurons in culture, which is blocked by XAV939.

We screened eight peptide candidates using the following criteria: (1) Inhibition and reversion of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) oligomers, quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); (2) direct binding of peptide candidates to the human receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), quantified by ELISA; (3) protection against A\u03b2 oligomer-induced neuronal cell death, using trypan blue to measure cell death in a murine neuronal cell line; (4) inhibition of TLR4 activation by S100A9, using a human TLR4 reporter cell line. We selected a 27-mer lead peptide that fulfilled these four criteria. This lead peptide is a privileged structure that displays inherent multitarget activity.

Their implication in pathologies is well documented for epilepsy. The higher prevalence of epileptic symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients questions the role of KARs in AD. Here we investigated whether the synaptic expression and function of KARs was impaired in mouse models of AD. We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude and decay time of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (male and female APP/PS1 mice) of AD. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was observed in CA3 pyramidal cells in male and female mice with a genetic deletion of either presenilin or APP/APLP2 as well as in organotypic cultures treated with \u03b3-secretase inhibitors. Finally, the GluK2 protein interacts with full-length and C-terminal fragments of APP.

In this context, many studies have addressed the dysregulation of AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). Kainate receptors (KARs) which form the third family of iGluRs, represent an underestimated actor in the regulation of neuronal circuits and have not yet been examined in the context of AD. Here we provide evidence that synaptic KARs are markedly impaired in a mouse model of AD.

To address these questions, we investigated microstructural alterations of two major cholinergic pathways in individuals along the AD continuum using an in vivo model of the human cholinergic system based on neuroimaging. We included 405 participants (53 AD, 66 MCI, 174 SCD, and 112 healthy controls) from the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE). We modelled the cholinergic white matter pathways with an enhanced diffusion neuroimaging pipeline that included probabilistic fiber-tracking methods and prior anatomical knowledge. The integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was compared between stages of the AD continuum, in the whole cohort and in a CSF amyloid-beta stratified subsample. The discriminative power of the integrity of the pathways was compared to the conventional volumetric measures of hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. A multivariate model was employed to investigate the role of these pathways in relation to cognitive performance. We found that the integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was significantly reduced in all stages of the AD continuum, including individuals with SCD. The differences involved posterior cholinergic white matter in the SCD stage and extended to anterior frontal white matter in MCI and AD dementia stages. Both cholinergic pathways and conventional volumetric measures showed higher predictive power in the more advanced stages of the disease, i.e., MCI and AD dementia. In contrast, the integrity of cholinergic pathways was more informative in distinguishing SCD from healthy controls, as compared with the volumetric measures. The multivariate model revealed a moderate contribution of the cholinergic white matter pathways but not of volumetric measures towards memory tests in the SCD and MCI stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cholinergic white matter pathways are altered already in SCD individuals, preceding the more widespread alterations found in MCI and AD.

Neuronal caspase-1 from inflammasome and cathepsin B are key enzymes mediating neuroinflammation in AD, therefore, revealing new molecules to modulate these enzymes may be an interesting approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we searched for new caspase-1 and cathepsin B inhibitors from five species of Brazilian marine invertebrates (four cnidarians and one echinoderm). The results show that the extract of the box jellyfish Chiropsalmus quadrumanus inhibits caspase-1. This extract was fractionated, and the products monitored for their inhibitory activity, until the obtention of a pure molecule, which was identified as trigonelline by mass spectrometry. Moreover, four extracts inhibit cathepsin B, and Exaiptasia diaphana was selected for subsequent fractionation and characterization, resulting in the identification of betaine as being responsible for the inhibitory action.

Here, we tested whether dystrophic microglia display customary markers of cell senescence by performing double and triple staining in sections of the temporal lobe and brain stem from 14 humans. We found that markers related to oxidative damage, such as upregulation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and y-H2AX, as well as inclusion of lipofuscin, do not or only exceptionally colocalize with dystrophic microglia. Further, we did not observe a decline in lamin B1 around nuclear laminae in either dystrophic or ramified microglia within the same microscopic field. Only ferritin expression, which is known to increase with aging in CNS microglia, was frequently observed in dystrophic, but rarely in ramified microglial cells. We conclude that neither dystrophic nor ramified microglia in human brain exhibit significant expression of conventional senescence markers associated with oxidative stress, and that ferritin is the dominant immunophenotypic change related to microglial aging.

We failed to find evidence surpassing correction for multiple comparisons of relationships between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and the risk for the 12 neuropsychiatric end points in either men or women. Drug-target analyses were generally well-powered to detect effect estimates at several hypothesized thresholds for both combined-sex and sex-specific end points, especially analyses using PCSK9 instruments derived from protein and expression quantitative trait loci. Further, MR estimates across complementary MR methods and additional models using genetic instruments derived from circulating PCSK9 protein levels and tissue-specific PCSK9 expression were in alignment, strengthening causal inference.

To date, the effects of Abeta42 accumulation on GABAergic synapses are poorly understood Our findings suggest that, similarly to what observed on glutamatergic synapses, Abeta42 modifies GABAergic synapses by targeting ryanodine receptors and causing calcium dysregulation The GABAergic impairments can be restored by the RyR-calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 Based on our research, RyRs stabilization may represent a novel pharmaceutical strategy for preventing or delaying of AD.Oligomeric form of amyloid beta protein Abeta42 contributes to the development of synaptic abnormalities and cognitive impairments associated with AD. To date, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how Abeta42 alters the elementary parameters of GABAergic synaptic function. Here we found that Abeta42 increased the frequency and amplitude of miniature GABAergic currents as well as the amplitude of evoked inhibitory post synaptic currents (eIPSCs). When we focused on paired pulse depression (PPD) to establish whether GABA release probability (p) was affected by Abeta42, we did not observe any significant change. On the other hand, a more detailed investigation of the presynaptic effects induced by Abeta42 by means of multiple probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) and cumulative amplitude analysis shown an increased size of both the readily releasable pool responsible for synchronous release (RRPsyn ) and the number of release sites (N). We further explored whether ryanodine receptors (RyRs) contributed to exacerbate these changes by stabilizing the interaction between RyRs and the accessory protein calstabin. We observed that the RyRs calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 restored the synaptic parameters to values comparable to those measured in control conditions. In conclusion, our results clarify the mechanisms of potentiation of GABAergic synapses induced by Abeta42. We further suggest that RyRs are involved in the control of synaptic activity during the early stage of AD onset and that their stabilization could represent a new therapeutical approach for AD treatment.

Abeta42 potentiates the synchronous release and increases the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous, leaving unaltered the size of RRP total. The number of release sites and the number of GABAergic receptors at the postsynaptic membrane are both increased by Abeta42.

Nevertheless, it has been reported that the model constructed by injection of A\u03b2 in combination with a prooxidant cocktail (ferrous sulfate, A\u03b2, and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (FAB)) best reflects the natural development of this disease.

Most studies investigating AD have focused on neurons and the gray matter in the central nervous system (CNS) but have not led to effective treatments.

Magnetic resonance imaging and pathology studies have shown different degrees of WM abnormality during the progression of AD.

WM damage is characterized by progressive degeneration of axons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and myelin in one or more areas of the CNS. The contributions of OLs to AD progression have, until recently, been largely overlooked. OLs are integral to myelin production, and the proliferation and differentiation of OLs, an early characteristic of AD, provide a promising target for preclinical diagnosis and treatment. However, despite some progress, the key mechanisms underlying the contributions of OLs to AD remain unclear.

Results from animal and cellular models suggest that FAD-deficient forms of NQO1 may accelerate the aggregation of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide Ab1-42. Here we examined in-vitro whether NQO1 and its FAD-deficient P187S mutation (NQO1*2) directly interact with Ab1-42 and modify its rate of aggregation. When monitored using the fluorescence of either non-covalent thioflavin T or HiLyte Fluor 647 dye covalently attached to the Ab1-42 peptide, the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42 were markedly more rapid in the presence of NQO1*2 than the wild-type NQO1. Experiments using apo-NQO1 indicate that this increase is linked to the inability of NQO1*2 to bind to FAD. Furthermore, dicoumarol, an NQO1 inhibitor which binds near the FAD binding site and stabilizes NQO1*2, markedly decreased the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42. Imaging flow cytometry confirmed in-vitro co-aggregation of NQO1 isoforms and Ab1-42.

It remains frustratingly unclear why this protein accumulates and how it contributes to Alzheimer's Disease pathology. In one recent hypothesis, Amyloid \u03b2 is suggested to function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immune defense within the brain, where Amyloid \u03b2 gains toxicity when it becomes abundant. This essay proposes an evolutionary explanation for why Amyloid \u03b2 expression is regulated at an optimum based on its function as a defense and how this leads to disease. Among its potential physiological functions, Amyloid \u03b2 confers benefits to reduce direct pathogen damage while this simultaneously entails cellular cost of defense. Optimal Amyloid \u03b2 expression occurs when the gain in fitness from an incremental increase is balanced by the marginal cost of this increase. It proposes that natural selection acting upon the young favored systems to maintain Amyloid \u03b2 at an optimal level through mechanisms that induce the defense and repress its expression. With age, the force of natural selection declines and permits mechanisms of negative feedback repression to degenerate. Consequently, Amyloid \u03b2 is expressed beyond its optimum. Age also elevates cumulative pathogen exposure, reduces pathogen barriers and reactivates latent pathogens. The net effect is elevated, chronic induction of Amyloid \u03b2 in the brain.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates genetic variation in BIN1 to be a better predictor of recognition memory than APOE, which remains the biggest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Male", "Humans", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Genotype", "Memory Disorders", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Nuclear Proteins", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing"]}, "36280370": {"ArticleTitle": "[Physical activity in the elderly with other major neurocognitive disorders].", "ArticleAbstract": "For decades, the literature was skeptical about the feasibility of motor rehabilitation and its impact, as well as that of physical activity (PA), in subjects with major neurocognitive disorders (MNCD), including Alzheimer's disease.

As most insulin is secreted in the bloodstream by the pancreas, its capacity to regulate brain functions must, at least partly, be mediated through the cerebral vasculature. However, how insulin interacts with the blood-brain barrier and whether alterations of this interaction could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology both remain poorly defined. Here, we show that human and murine cerebral insulin receptors (INSRs), particularly the long isoform INSR\u03b1-B, are concentrated in microvessels rather than in the parenchyma. Vascular concentrations of INSR\u03b1-B were lower in the parietal cortex of subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positively correlating with cognitive scores, leading to a shift towards a higher INSR\u03b1-A/B ratio, consistent with cerebrovascular insulin resistance in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Vascular INSR\u03b1 was inversely correlated with amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, but positively correlated with insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and P-glycoprotein. Using brain cerebral intracarotid perfusion, we found that the transport rate of insulin across the blood-brain barrier remained very low (<0.03\u2005\u00b5l/g\u00b7s) and was not inhibited by an insulin receptor antagonist. However, intracarotid perfusion of insulin induced the phosphorylation of INSR\u03b2 that was restricted to microvessels. Such an activation of vascular insulin receptor was blunted in 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease neuropathology induces insulin resistance at the level of the blood-brain barrier. Overall, the present data in post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brains and an animal model of Alzheimer's disease indicate that defects in the insulin receptor localized at the blood-brain barrier strongly contribute to brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease, in association with \u03b2-amyloid pathology.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36280008": {"ArticleTitle": "Selective orexin 1 receptor antagonist SB-334867 aggravated cognitive dysfunction in 3xTg-AD mice.", "ArticleAbstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is the main clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous research found that elevated orexin level in the cerebrospinal fluid was closely related to the course of AD, and orexin-A treatment could increase amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) deposition and aggravate spatial memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, recent research found that dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonist might affect A\u03b2 level and cognitive dysfunction in AD, but the effects of OX1R or OX2R alone is unreported until now. Considering that OX1R is highly expressed in the hippocampus and plays important roles in learning and memory, the effects of OX1R in AD cognitive dysfunction and its possible mechanism should be investigated. In the present study, selective OX1R antagonist SB-334867 was used to block OX1R. Then, different behavioral tests were performed to observe the effects of OX1R blockade on cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice exhibited both A\u03b2 and tau pathology, in vivo electrophysiological recording and western blot were used to investigate the potential mechanism. The results showed that chronic OX1R blockade aggravated the impairments of short-term working memory, long-term spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in 9-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice, increased levels of soluble A\u03b2 oligomers and p-tau, and decreased PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. These results indicate that the detrimental effects of SB-334867 on cognitive behaviors in 3xTg-AD mice are closely related to the decrease of PSD-95 and depression of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) caused by increased A\u03b2 oligomers and p-tau.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36279229": {"ArticleTitle": "[A role of human microbiota in the development of neurodegenerative diseases].", "ArticleAbstract": "Improving the quality of life in developed countries has contributed to an increase in its duration, which has led to an increase in the number of reported cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in the world. Today, there are 26.6 million patients with AD in the world and it is suspected that by 2050 the number of such patients may increase four times. Additionally, PD in different countries is recorded among people above 60-65 years old at a level of 167 to 5703 per 100.000 population. The latest studies have made it possible to formulate the main mechanisms of the \u00abmicrobiota-gut-brain\u00bb axis associated with the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the currently available information on the possible role of the gut microbiota in the AD and PD development. It was shown that oxidative stress is one of the main pathogenetic mechanisms of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the deposition of lipopolysaccharides of gram-negative bacteria and amyloid of microbial origin in the brain tissue of patients with impaired permeability of the intestinal barrier plays an important role in AD. In PD, the synthesis of \u03b1-synuclein produced by bacteria and neuroinflammation are of the greatest importance. Knowledge of these mechanisms will allow the development of psychobiotics, which will reduce the risk of neurodegeneration in AD and PD.\u041f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435

"[Focused ultrasound as a non-invasive method with therapeutic potential in patients with Alzheimer's disease].", "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal deposition of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of this method in patients with AD.\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430

most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. One of the most significant factors leading to vascular dementia is stroke, which increases the risk of developing dementia by about 2 times. Delayed-onset post-stroke dementia is mainly due to severe small vessel disease, recurrent stroke, or concomitant Alzheimer's disease. Among the many mechanisms involved in the development of vascular cognitive impairment, cerebral small vessel disease is perhaps the most common, contributing to cognitive impairment independent of stroke. An important feature of small vessel disease is its steady progression. The cognitive decline in cerebrovascular disease, including small vessel disease, is also usually gradual and gradual, progresses slowly, and the underlying defect extends to processing speed, complex attention, and fronto-executive functions. Vascular cognitive impairments are quite heterogeneous in nature, while having a negative impact on all major cognitive domains. Patient management should include the earliest possible diagnosis of cognitive impairment and the appointment of timely therapy. One of the drugs that has been successfully used to treat vascular cognitive impairment is nicergoline (Sermion). The clinical efficacy of the drug is achieved due to the improvement of cerebral blood flow, a positive effect on cholinergic neurotransmission and neuroprotective action.\u0421\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f

Prior to death, participants were observed for a mean (SD) of 8.4 (5.3) years with annual assessments. From 2096 participants who died, 1799 (85.8%) underwent autopsy and 1767 had complete postmortem pathological examination data at the time of data analyses. To identify participants without neurodegenerative pathologies, we categorized them in 3 subgroups. A vascular subgroup was composed of participants without significant levels of neurodegenerative brain pathologies. A neurodegenerative subgroup was composed of participants without significant levels of cerebrovascular disease pathologies. A mixed subgroup was composed of the rest of the participants. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to July 2022.Brain pathology indices obtained by postmortem pathological assessments.The primary outcome was cognitive impairment defined by presence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The secondary outcome was cognition assessed by 19 neuropsychological tests.Of 1767 included participants, 1189 (67.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age at death was 89.4 (6.6) years.

In biochemical assays, brain glutathione (GSH) declined with age in both 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic controls, but the decline was accelerated in 3xTg-AD brains from 2 to 4 months. The decline in GSH correlated exponentially with the rise in iA\u03b2. Integrated metabolic signaling as the ratio of phospho-Akt (pAkt) to total Akt (tAkt) in the PI3kinase and mTOR pathway declined at 6, 9, and 12 months, before rising at 16 and 20 months. These pAkt/tAkt ratios correlated with both iA\u03b2 and GSH levels in a U-shaped relationship. Selective vulnerability of age-related AD-genotype-specific pAkt changes was greatest in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. To demonstrate redox causation, iA\u03b2 accumulation was lowered in cultured middle-age adult 3xTg-AD neurons by treatment of the oxidized redox state in the neurons with exogenous cysteine.The order of pathologic progression in the 3xTg-AD mouse was loss of GSH (oxidative redox shift) followed by an pAkt/tAkt metabolic shift in CA1, iA\u03b2 accumulation in CA1, and extracellular A\u03b2 deposition.

We also show that boundary work has proved unable to point a way out of the deadlock and argue that the science system's tools for establishing scientific quality, such as peer review and the grant system, are unlikely to resolve the crisis. Rather, they consolidate the dominant model's position even more. In conclusion, we suggest that some kind of reverse boundary-work is needed that reopens the discussion on the nature of AD, an issue that has never been settled scientifically. Drawing on historical and philosophical work, we make clear that the definition of AD as a biomedical disease for which a cure can be found has consequences, not only for funding opportunities, but also for patients and their lives. A reconsideration of the desirability of these consequences may lead to different choices with respect to research priorities and patient care.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36278349": {"ArticleTitle": "Synaptic Proteins as Fluid Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.", "ArticleAbstract": "Synaptic disruption precedes neuronal death and correlates with clinical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Baroreflex responses were analyzed in anesthetized STZ-AD rats using femoral catheterization for blood pressure and heart rate, and autonomic activity was assessed using specific blockers and splanchnic sympathetic nerve recordings. Expression levels of autonomic receptors at the heart were examined using the western blot technique.Baroreflex function in STZ-AD showed a blunted heart rate (HR) response to low blood pressure challenges, and the maximal sympathetic nerve activity was reduced. Conversely, HR responses to high blood pressure were similar to control, indicating no change in parasympathetic nerve activity. Under resting conditions, autonomic blockade demonstrated a baseline shift to increased sympathetic tone in STZ-AD. Protein expression levels of beta-1 adrenergic receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 in the heart were unchanged.Our study provides the first data on the pathological influence of AD on baroreflex function, which primarily affected the sympathetic nervous system in STZ-AD.

Herein, three different 89Zr-labeling strategies and direct radioiodination with 125I of a bispecific anti-amyloid-beta aducanumab derivate, consisting of aducanumab with a C-terminal fused anti-transferrin receptor binding single chain Fab fragment derived from 8D3 (Adu-8D3), were compared ex vivo and in vivo with regard to brain uptake and target engagement in an APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mouse model and wild type animals. Methods: Adu-8D3 and a negative control antibody, based on the HIV specific B12 antibody also carrying C-terminal fused 8D3 scFab (B12-8D3), were each conjugated with NCS-DFO, NCS-DFO*, or TFP-N-suc-DFO-Fe-ester, followed by radiolabeling with 89Zr. 125I was used as a substitute for 124I for labeling of both antibodies. 30 \u00b5g of radiolabeled mAb, corresponding to approximately 6 MBq 89Zr or 2.5 MBq 125I, were injected per mouse. PET imaging was performed 1, 3 and 7 days post injection (p.i.). All mice were sacrificed on day 7 p.i. and subjected to ex vivo biodistribution and brain autoradiography. Immunostaining on brain tissue was performed after autoradiography for further validation. Results: Ex vivo biodistribution revealed that the brain uptake of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 (2.19 \u00b10.12 %ID/g) was as high as for its 125I-analog (2.21 \u00b10.15 %ID/g). [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-N-suc-Adu-8D3 showed significantly lower uptake (< 0.65 %ID/g), being in the same range as for the 89Zr-labeled controls (B12-8D3). Autoradiography of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [125I]I-Adu-8D3 showed an amyloid-beta related granular uptake pattern of radioactivity. In contrast, the [89Zr]Zr-DFO-conjugates and the control antibody groups did not show any amyloid-beta related uptake pattern, indicating that DFO is inferior for 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging of the brain in comparison to DFO* for Adu-8D3. This was confirmed by day 7 PET images showing only amyloid-beta related brain uptake for [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3. In wild type animals, such an uptake was not observed. Immunostaining showed a co-localization of all administered Adu-8D3 conjugates with amyloid-beta plaques.

Focused ultrasound applied together with microbubbles (FUS+MB) is a novel technique to transiently open the BBB and increase drug delivery. Evidence suggests that FUS+MB is safe, however, the effects of FUS+MB on human BBB cells, especially in the context of AD, remain sparsely investigated. In addition, there currently are no cell platforms to test for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery. Methods: Here we generated BBB cells (induced brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs) and astrocytes (iAstrocytes)) from apolipoprotein E gene allele E4 (APOE4, high sporadic AD risk) and allele E3 (APOE3, lower AD risk) carrying patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We established mono- and co-culture models of human sporadic AD and control BBB cells to investigate the effects of FUS+MB on BBB cell phenotype and to screen for the delivery of two potentially therapeutic AD antibodies, an Aducanumab-analogue (AduhelmTM; anti-amyloid-\u03b2) and a novel anti-Tau antibody, RNF5. We then developed a novel hydrogel-based 2.5D BBB model as a step towards a more physiologically relevant FUS+MB drug delivery platform. Results: When compared to untreated cells, the delivery of Aducanumab-analogue and RNF5 was significantly increased (up to 1.73 fold), across the Transwell-based BBB models following FUS+MB treatment. Our results also demonstrated the safety of FUS+MB indicated by minimal changes in iBEC transcriptome as well as little or no changes in iBEC or iAstrocyte viability and inflammatory responses within the first 24 h post FUS+MB. Furthermore, we demonstrated successful iBEC barrier formation in our novel 2.5D hydrogel-based BBB model with significantly increased delivery (1.4 fold) of Aducanumab-analogue following FUS+MB. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a robust and reproducible approach to utilize patient cells for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery screening in vitro.

In the present study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine how lysophospholipids influence the liquid-ordered domains in model ternary membranes.

Hearing loss is one of the modifiable risk factors for dementia, with approximately 4 million of the 50 million cases of dementia worldwide possibly attributed to untreated HL. This paper describes four possible mechanisms that have been suggested for the relationship between age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia. The first mechanism suggests mitochondrial dysfunction and altered signal pathways due to aging as a possible link between ARHL and AD. The second mechanism proposes that sensory degradation in hearing impaired people could explain the relationship between ARHL and AD. The occupation of cognitive resource (third) mechanism indicates that the association between ARHL and AD is a result of increased cognitive processing that is required to compensate for the degraded sensory input. The fourth mechanism is an expansion of the third mechanism, i.e., the function and structure interaction involves both cognitive resource occupation (neural activity) and AD pathology as the link between ARHL and AD. Exploring the specific mechanisms that provide the link between ARHL and AD has the potential to lead to innovative ideas for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of AD.

The results on mean ARC for the four groups were significantly different, small, positive, and age-insensitive in the HC group, while ARC was negative and declined with time/disease advancement in AD. The differences between HC and aAD groups in mean ARC and domain-specific ARC were not significant, indicating a subtle PE in aAD in the early preclinical stage of AD.

Tauopathy can impair cognitive and motor functions and has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The aetiology of tauopathy remains mysterious; however, recent studies suggest that the autophagic-endolysosomal function plays an essential role in the degradation and transmission of pathological tau. We previously demonstrated that tetrandrine could ameliorate memory functions and clear amyloid plaques in transgenic AD mice by restoring autophagic-endolysosomal function. However, the efficacy of tetrandrine and the associated therapeutic mechanism in tauopathies have not been evaluated and elucidated.Novel object recognition, fear conditioning and electrophysiology were used to evaluate the effects of tetrandrine on memory functions in transgenic tau mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the effect of tetrandrine on autophagy and tau clearance in vivo. Calcium (Ca2+) imaging and flow cytometry were used to delineate the role of pathological tau and tetrandrine in lysosomal Ca2+ and pH homeostasis. Biochemical BiFC fluorescence, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas coculture of brain slices with isolated microglia was used to evaluate tau clearance ex vivo.We observed that tetrandrine treatment mitigated tau tangle development and corrected memory impairment in Thy1-hTau.P301S transgenic mice. Mechanistically, we showed that mutant tau expression disrupts lysosome pH by increasing two-pore channel 2 (TPC2)-mediated Ca2+ release, thereby contributing to lysosome alkalinization. Tetrandrine inhibits TPC2, thereby restoring the lysosomal pH, promotes tau degradation via autophagy, and ameliorates tau aggregation. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, we demonstrated that tetrandrine treatment promotes pathological tau clearance by microglia.Together, these findings suggest that pathological tau disturbs endolysosomal homeostasis to impair tau clearance. This impairment results in a vicious cycle that accelerates disease pathogenesis. The success of tetrandrine in reducing tau aggregation suggests first, that tetrandrine could be an effective drug for tauopathies and second, that rescuing lysosomal Ca2+ homeostasis, thereby restoring ALP function, could be an effective general strategy for the development of novel therapies for tauopathies.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Animals", "Mice", "tau Proteins", "Calcium", "Disease Models, Animal", "Tauopathies", "Mice, Transgenic", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognition"]}, "36272585": {"ArticleTitle": "Soluble TREM2 and Alzheimer-related biomarker trajectories in the blood of patients with diabetes based on their cognitive status.", "ArticleAbstract": "We aimed to elucidate the dynamics of blood biomarkers according to the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to identify useful biomarkers for diabetes-related dementia.This was a cross-sectional, nested case-control study of 121 Japanese DM and non-DM patients with different levels of cognitive functioning.

In AD, a subpopulation of astrocytes acquires a neurotoxic phenotype which prompts them to lose typical physiological features. While the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, evidence suggests that myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein may play a role in coordinating these cells' immune responses in AD. Herein, we combined studies in human postmortem samples with a conditional genetic knockout mouse model to investigate the link between MyD88 and astrocytes in AD. In silico analyses of bulk and cell-specific transcriptomic data from human postmortem brains demonstrated an upregulation of MyD88 expression in astrocytes in AD versus non-AD individuals. Proteomic studies revealed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein in multiple brain regions of AD subjects. These studies also showed that although overall MyD88 steady-state levels were unaffected by AD, this protein was enriched in astrocytes near amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Functional studies in mice indicated that the deletion of astrocytic MyD88 protected animals from the acute synaptic toxicity and cognitive impairment caused by the intracerebroventricular administration of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Lastly, unbiased proteomic analysis revealed that loss of astrocytic MyD88 resulted in altered astrocyte reactivity, lower levels of immune-related proteins, and higher expression of synaptic-related proteins in response to A\u03b2.

Conversely, there is a realization that non-fibrillar (oligomeric) forms of A\u03b2 mediate toxicity in AD. Fibrillar (filamentous) aggregates of proteins across the spectrum of the primary and secondary tauopathies were the focus of recent structural studies with a filament structure based nosologic classification, but less emphasis was given to non-filamentous co-aggregates of insoluble proteins in the fractions derived from post-mortem human brains. Here, we revisited sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble extracts to characterize tau and A\u03b2 species by quantitative targeted mass spectrometric proteomics, biochemical assays, and electron microscopy. AD brain sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were greatly enriched with A\u03b242 at almost equimolar levels to N-terminal truncated microtubule binding region (MTBR) isoforms of tau with multiple site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). MTBR R3 and R4 tau peptides were most abundant in the sarkosyl-insoluble materials with a 10-fold higher concentration than N-terminal tau peptides. This indicates that the major proportion of the enriched tau was the aggregation prone N-terminal and proline rich region (PRR) of truncated mixed 4R and 3R tau with more 4R than 3R isoforms.

Therefore, there is a great need for therapeutic candidate that enhances microglial A\u03b2 clearance while inhibiting microglia's pathogenic properties.In vivo studies were conducted with 5xFAD AD model mice by treating gossypetin for 13 weeks through intragastric administration.

The goal of the medical-nursing integration model is to realize the integrated model of medical care-nursing-rehabilitation-old care, and to better satisfy the needs by providing medical services, rehabilitation care, and health management. The medical needs of the elderly can help the elderly maintain a healthy state; the elderly care needs can be better met through elderly care services, and the burden on families and society can be reduced. With the advancement of the medical-care integration model, new solutions have been provided for the management of senile dementia patients. Therefore, under the medical-care integration model, this paper managed Alzheimer's patients based on the big data algorithm based on association rules and compared it with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, and drew the following conclusions: compared with the management satisfaction of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, family members and patients' total satisfaction with nursing management under the medical-care integration model was greatly improved; compared with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, the incidence of adverse events in the management of Alzheimer's patients under the medical-care integration model was greatly reduced, which was reduced to 17.6%; under the medical-care integration model, the anxiety and depression scores of the elderly patients with dementia decreased rapidly; under the medical-care integration model, the living ability of senile dementia patients has been greatly improved; the use of the medical-care integration model to manage senile dementia patients has greatly improved the sleep quality, mental quality, and quality of life of senile dementia patients.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Humans", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Quality of Life", "Big Data", "Family", "Anxiety"]}, "36267702": {"ArticleTitle": "Role of mitophagy in the neurodegenerative diseases and its pharmacological advances: A review.", "ArticleAbstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of incurable and debilitating diseases characterized by progressive degeneration and death of cells in the central nervous system.

However, semi-quantitative measures may potentially be affected by changes in blood flow, whereas quantitative measures such as binding potential (BPND) are not. For [18F]flortaucipir PET the sensitivity of SUVr for changes in blood flow has not been investigated yet. This is important, because [18F]flortaucipir PET is an important outcome measure in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore we compared semi-quantitative (SUVr) and quantitative (R1, BPND) parameters of longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir PET scans, and assessed their vulnerability to changes in blood flow. Subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; n = 38) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (n = 24) underwent baseline (BL) and 2-year follow-up (FU) dynamic [18F]flortaucipir PET scans. BPND and R1 were estimated using receptor parametric mapping (RPM) and SUVr(80-100min) was calculated. For each region-of-interest ((trans)entorhinal, limbic and neocortical) and parameter, %change was calculated. Regional SUVrs were compared to corresponding DVR (= BPND+1) using paired T-tests. Additionally, simulations were performed to model effects of (large(r)) flow changes on BPND and SUVr in different binding categories. Thereafter, %bias for SUVr with respect to underlying binding and flow were evaluated. Results in SCD and AD showed only minor differences between SUVr and BPND %change. R1 changes were small (+0.7% in SCD and -1.6% in AD). Simulations illustrated a variable %bias for SUVr depending on the underlying binding condition. Concluding, in line with established practices, SUVr provided an accurate estimate of specific binding for [18F]flortaucipir over a two-year follow-up during which changes in flow were small, also in AD patients. Notwithstanding, simulations showed that large(r) flow changes may potentially affect [18F]flortaucipir SUVr. Given that it is currently unknown to what order of magnitude pharmacotherapeutic interventions may induce changes in cerebral blood flow, caution may be warranted in situations where changes in flow are large(r) and DVR/BPND may be preferred in such conditions to ensure representative quantification of [18F]flortaucipir PET images.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36265268": {"ArticleTitle": "Guanidine-based \u03b2 amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors for the Alzheimer's disease (AD): A review.", "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurological disorder characterized by amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (hyper p-tau), neuronal damage, memory loss, etc. Various factors, such as age, lifestyle, family history, environmental factors, and gene mutation, cause AD.

Application of the VLM in a 2017 study failed to find different variant loads in AD patients compared to controls, in two cohorts of European origin. The study also suggested a lower variant load in healthy elderly individuals, but could offer no replicate cohort to support this observation. Here, the VLM is applied to Japanese mtDNA sequences; in doing so, we explored the role of mtDNA variation in AD and ageing in a different global population. Consistent with the previous findings using the VLM in two populations of European origin, we found no evidence for an association between rarer, non-haplogroup associated variation and the development of AD. However, the result in the context of ageing that suggested those with fewer mildly deleterious mutations might undergo healthier ageing, was not replicated. In contrast to our previous study, our present results suggest that those living to advanced old age may harbour more mildly deleterious mtDNA variations.

Whether BACE1 and neurogranin levels are persistent traits or change with disease progression is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CSF neurogranin and BACE1 concentrations differ between A/T/N stages, whether these change over time and correlate with memory decline.

We used CSF markers to determine A/T/N stage using amyloid beta42/40 ratio, p-tau181 and total-tau respectively in predementia Alzheimer's disease cases (n = 176) [including cases that progressed to dementia (n = 10)] and controls (n = 74) from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation cohort.

A subset of subjects in all A/T/N groups underwent repeat CSF sampling at approximately 2-year intervals up to 6 years from baseline. Using linear mixed models, longitudinal measurements of CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in A+/T-/N- and A+/T+/N+ as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls were performed. Next, we measured changes in CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in cases that progressed from A-/T-/N- to A+/T-/N- (n = 12), from A+/T-/N- to A+/T or N+ (n = 12), remained stable A+/T-/N- (n = 26), remained stable A+/T+/N+ (n = 28) compared with controls remaining stable A-/T-/N- (n = 33).

In contrast, BACE1 was lower in A+/T-/N- (P < 0.05) and higher in A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001).

However, the relationships between protein synthesis deregulation and ER stress/UPR, as well as their role in the altered homeostatic support of Alzheimer's disease (AD) astrocytes remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2\u03b1 and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker (EML) resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2\u03b1 without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2\u03b1 and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent.

The sorting of this enzyme into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes regulates the BACE1-mediated cleavage of its substrates, however, the mechanisms underlying this targeting remain poorly understood. The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface. Of note, shedding of the extracellular domain of Sez6, a protein cleaved exclusively by BACE1, is reduced in NCAM2-deficient animals.

In contrast to A\u03b2, abnormally phosphorylated \u03c4 (p-\u03c4) can also be found in non-AD tauopathies. In AD, p-\u03c4 is the main component of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which result from aggregation of abnormally phosphorylated and folded \u03c4. In this review, we discuss the role of p-\u03c4 pathology in Alzheimer's disease considering neuropathological, biochemical, cellular, animal model, and clinical findings. We discuss the relationship between p-\u03c4 and other AD-related proteins such as A\u03b2 and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). In light of the current state of knowledge, we conclude that p-\u03c4 aggregation known as primary age-related tauopathy (PART) may represent a prerequisite for the development of AD rather that a downstream effect of A\u03b2 toxicity. However, A\u03b2 as well as TDP-43 pathology appear to accelerate accumulation and propagation of p-\u03c4 pathology once initiated, ultimately leading to the full-blown picture of AD. In this context, \u03c4 seeds can induce granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD), AD-typical lesions in which the activated necrosome - required for the execution of necroptosis, a programmed form of cell death - can be found. Moreover, necrosome-exhibiting GVD is associated with a decreased neuronal density. Thus, we speculate that p-\u03c4 pathology is a major driver for neuron loss in AD via GVD-mediated necroptosis. Overall, p-\u03c4 seems to play a central role in AD as it appears to constitute a prerequisite for AD development which can then be accelerated by co-factors. This would fit in a probabilistic model of AD, in which the presence and severity of the respective co-factors such as A\u03b2, TDP-43, and others contribute separately to AD pathogenesis as probabilistic factors with a certain weight.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Animals", "Neurofibrillary Tangles", "tau Proteins", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Tauopathies", "Nerve Degeneration", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Cell Death"]}, "36243270": {"ArticleTitle": "Altered brain iron depositions from aging to Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease: A quantitative susceptibility mapping study.", "ArticleAbstract": "Brain iron deposition is a promising marker for human brain health, providing insightful information for understanding aging as well as neurodegenerations, e.g., Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

For decades, research has focused on neuronal degeneration and the disruption to the neural circuits that occurs during disease progression, undervaluing in some extent the alterations to glial cells even though these alterations were described in the very first studies of this disease. In recent years, it has been recognized that different families of neuroglia are not merely support cells for neurons but rather key and active elements in the physiology and pathology of the nervous system. Alterations to different types of neuroglia (especially astroglia and microglia but also mature oligodendroglia and oligodendroglial progenitors) have been identified in the initial neuropathological changes that lead to dementia, suggesting that they may represent therapeutic targets to prevent neurodegeneration. In this review, based on our own studies and on the relevant scientific literature, we argue that a careful and in-depth study of glial cells will be fundamental to understanding the origin and progression of Alzheimer's disease.

A precise medical diagnosis that correctly classifies AD patients results in better treatment. Currently, the most commonly used classification techniques extract features from longitudinal MRI data before creating a single classifier that performs classification. However, it is difficult to train a reliable classifier to achieve acceptable classification performance due to limited sample size and noise in longitudinal MRI data. Instead of creating a single classifier, we propose an ensemble voting method that generates multiple individual classifier predictions and then combines them to develop a more accurate and reliable classifier. The ensemble voting classifier model performs better in the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset for older adults than existing methods in important assessment criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC.

Around 23 million tons of oats are consumed globally, making up a sizeable portion of the global grain market. Oat seedlings contain more protein, beta-glucan, free amino acids, and phenolic compounds than seeds. The progressive neurodegenerative disorder of Alzheimer's is accompanied by worsening memory and cognitive function. A key indicator of this disorder is the unusual buildup of amyloid-beta protein (or A\u03b2) in human brains. In this context, oat seedling extract (OSE) has been identified as a new therapeutic candidate for AD, due to its antioxidant activity and AD-specific mechanism of action. This study directly investigated how OSE affected AD and its impacts by examining the cognitive function and exploring the inflammatory response mechanism. The dried oat seedlings were grounded finely with a grinder, inserted with 50% fermented ethanol 10 times (w/v), and extracted by stirring for 10 h at 45 \u00b0C. After filtering the extract by 0.22 um filter, some of it was used for UHPLC analysis. The results indicated that the treatment with OSE protects against A\u03b225-35-induced cytotoxicity in BV2 cells. Tg-5Xfad AD mice had strong deposition of A\u03b2 throughout their brains, while WT mice did not exhibit any such deposition within their brains. A drastic reduction was observed in terms of numbers, as well as the size, of A\u03b2 plaques within Tg-5Xfad AD mice exposed to OSE. This study indicated OSE's neuroprotective impacts against neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation induced by amyloid-beta. Our results suggest that OSE acts as a neuroprotective agent to combat AD-specific apoptotic cell death, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta accumulation, as well as synaptic dysfunction in AD mice's brains.

In order to understand the mechanism of gut microbiota in AD, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolites. Behavioral tests, pathological examination, metagenomics, and metabolomics were applied to analyze the difference of gut microbiota and metabolome between APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 (PAP) mice with cognitive decline and age-matched controls, and their possible correlations. Our results showed that PAP mice and health mice had different structures of the bacterial communities in the gut. The abundances and diversities of the bacterial communities in health mice were higher than in PAP mice by metagenomics analysis. The abundances of Libanicoccus massiliensis, Paraprevotella clara, and Lactobacillus amylovorus were significantly increased in PAP mice, while the abundances of Turicibacter sanguinis, Dubosiella newyorkensis, and Prevotella oris were greatly reduced. Furthermore, PAP mice possessed peculiar metabolic phenotypes in stool, serum, and hippocampus relative to WT mice, as is demonstrated by alterations in neurotransmitters metabolism, lipid metabolism, aromatic amino acids metabolism, energy metabolism, vitamin digestion and absorption, and bile metabolism. Microbiota-host metabolic correlation analysis suggests that abnormal metabolism in stool, serum, and hippocampus of PAP mice may be modulated by the gut microbiota, especially T. sanguinis, D. newyorkensis, and P. oris. Therefore, abnormal metabolism activity is associated with gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease mice.

These disorders, termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), possess neuropathologic similarities to Alzheimer's disease (AD), including intra- and extracellular amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide aggregates. A\u03b2 peptide is produced through cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta secretase BACE1.

Previous studies have found that BACE1 expression was increased in the CNS of PWH with HAND as well as animal models of HAND. Further, BACE1 contributed to neurotoxicity. Yet in in vitro models, the role of ADAM10 and its potential regulatory mechanisms had not been examined. To address this, primary rat cortical neurons were treated with supernatants from HIV-infected human macrophages (HIV/MDMs). We found that HIV/MDMs decreased levels of both ADAM10 and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a regulator of ADAM10 that is implicated in aging and in AD. Both decreases were blocked with NMDA receptor antagonists, and treatment with NMDA was sufficient to induce reduction in ADAM10 and SIRT1 protein levels. Furthermore, decreases in SIRT1 protein levels were observed at an earlier time point than the decreases in ADAM10 protein levels, and the reduction in SIRT1 was reversed by proteasome inhibitor MG132.

Molecular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are now part of the established diagnostic tools for the clinical investigation of cognitive disorders in the elderly. Biomarkers allow for earlier and more accurate differential diagnosis, and are recommended by the Swiss Memory Clinics as an additional investigation based upon individual indication. Information and counselling are needed both before and after biomarker-supported diagnosis. The procedures for diagnostic lumbar punctures and pre-analytical sample handling should follow published recommendations. The results must be interpreted in the context of the other available history and assessment outcome. Thanks to recent research progress, blood-based biomarkers and other non-invasive markers are expected to become available for clinical practice in the near future. This trend will likely lead to a much broader utilisation of biomarkers and may accelerate the development of effective and individually tailored prevention and treatment approaches. This review article provides an overview over the current state of biomarkers and provides the recommendations of the Swiss Memory Clinics for their use in clinical practice.Zusammenfassung.

Additionally, a subset of participants also provided paired cerebrospinal fluid samples to compare neuronal SEV miRNAs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Neuronal SEV were isolated using differential ultracentrifugation and antibody conjugated Dynabeads\u00ae for the neuronal surface marker, L1CAM. RNA sequencing was performed. 12 FTD, 11 with AD, and 10 healthy aging participants were enrolled in the study. In FTD, SEV miRNA-181c was downregulated compared to healthy controls. In AD, miRNA-122 and miRNA-3591 were downregulated compared to those in healthy controls and FTD. Using an FDR <0.2, only miRNA-21-5p was found to have increased expression in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to plasma in a group of AD and FTD participants. SEV miRNA-181c is significantly downregulated in FTD compared to healthy controls and may mediate its effects through microglial-directed neuroinflammation and interaction with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) based on pathway analysis.

Early detection of altered synaptic transmission and insight into mechanisms causing early synaptic alterations would be valuable treatment strategies. This study aimed to investigate how whole-brain networks are influenced at pre- and early-plague stages of AD and if these manifestations are associated with concomitant cellular and synaptic deficits.\u00a0 METHODS: To this end, we used an established AD rat model (TgF344-AD) and employed resting state functional MRI and quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis, a method to detect recurrent spatiotemporal motifs of brain activity, in parallel with state-of-the-art immunohistochemistry in selected brain regions.At the pre-plaque stage, QPPs in TgF344-AD rats showed decreased activity of the basal forebrain (BFB) and the default mode-like network. Histological analyses revealed increased astrocyte abundance restricted to the BFB, in the absence of amyloid plaques, tauopathy, and alterations in a number of cholinergic, gaba-ergic, and glutamatergic synapses. During the early-plaque stage, when mild amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) accumulation was observed in the cortex and hippocampus, QPPs in the TgF344-AD rats normalized suggesting the activation of compensatory mechanisms during this early disease progression period. Interestingly, astrogliosis observed in the BFB at the pre-plaque stage was absent at the early-plaque stage. Moreover, altered excitatory/inhibitory balance was observed in cortical regions belonging to the default mode-like network. In wild-type rats, at both time points, peak activity in the BFB preceded peak activity in other brain regions-indicating its modulatory role during QPPs. However, this pattern was eliminated in TgF344-AD suggesting that alterations in BFB-directed neuromodulation have a pronounced impact in network function in AD.This study demonstrates the value of rsfMRI and advanced network analysis methods to detect early alterations in BFB function in AD, which could aid early diagnosis and intervention in AD.

Serum total TDP-43 levels measured with a single-molecule array (Simoa) were compared within the FTD group according to the genotype, clinical phenotype, and predicted neuropathological subtype of the patients. We also evaluated the associations between the TDP-43 levels and disease severity or survival in FTD.Total TDP-43 levels in the serum were significantly lower in the FTD group as compared to the healthy control group (275.3 pg/mL vs. 361.8 pg/mL, B = 0.181, 95%CI = 0.014-0.348, p = 0.034). The lowest TDP-43 levels were observed in the subgroup of FTD patients harboring predicted TDP-43 brain pathology (FTD-TDP, 241.4 pg/mL). The low levels in the FTD-TDP group were especially driven by C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers (169.2 pg/mL) and FTD patients with concomitant motoneuron disease (FTD-MND, 113.3 pg/mL), whereas GRN mutation carriers did not show decreased TDP-43 levels (328.6 pg/mL). Serum TDP-43 levels showed no correlation with disease severity nor progression in FTD.Our results indicate that the total levels of TDP-43 in the serum are decreased especially in FTD patients with the C9orf72 repeat expansion or FTD-MND phenotype, both subtypes strongly associated with TDP-43 type B brain pathology. Serum-based measurement of TDP-43 could represent a useful tool in indicating C9orf72 repeat expansion and FTD-MND-related TDP-43 neuropathology for future diagnostics and intervention studies.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["C9orf72 Protein", "DNA Repeat Expansion", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Motor Neuron Disease", "Motor Neurons", "Phenotype"]}, "36217155": {"ArticleTitle": "Increasing brain glucose metabolism by ligustrazine piperazine ameliorates cognitive deficits through PPAR\u03b3-dependent enhancement of mitophagy in APP/PS1 mice.", "ArticleAbstract": "PPAR\u03b3 agonists have been proven to be neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In this context, animal models that progressively display AD pathological hallmarks (e.g. TgF344-AD) become crucial. Translational technologies, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), enable the longitudinal metabolic characterization of this disease. However, an integrative approach is required to unravel the complex metabolic changes underlying AD progression, from early to advanced stages. TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) rats were studied in vivo on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner, for longitudinal quantitative assessment of brain metabolic profile changes using MRS. Disease progression was investigated at 4 time points, from 9 to 18\u00a0months of age, and in 4 regions: cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Compared to WT, TgF344-AD rats replicated common findings in AD patients, including decreased N-acetylaspartate in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased glutamate in the thalamus and striatum. Different longitudinal evolution of metabolic concentration was observed between TgF344-AD and WT groups. Namely, age-dependent trajectories differed between groups for creatine in the cortex and thalamus and for taurine in cortex, with significant decreases in Tg344-AD animals; whereas myo-inositol in the thalamus and striatum showed greater increase along time in the WT group. Additional analysis revealed divergent intra- and inter-regional metabolic coupling in each group. Thus, in cortex, strong couplings of N-acetylaspartate and creatine with myo-inositol in WT, but with taurine in TgF344-AD rats were observed; whereas in the hippocampus, myo-inositol, taurine and choline compounds levels were highly correlated in WT but not in TgF344-AD animals. Furthermore, specific cortex-hippocampus-striatum metabolic crosstalks were found for taurine levels in the WT group but for myo-inositol levels in the TgF344-AD rats. With a systems biology perspective of metabolic changes in AD pathology, our results shed light into the complex spatio-temporal metabolic rewiring in this disease, reported here for the first time.

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT with a limited treatment duration in AD.We developed a Markov state-transition model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone among Americans living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD. AD states included MCI due to AD, mild AD, moderate AD, severe AD, and death. A hypothetical DMT was assumed to confer a 30% reduction in progression from MCI and mild AD. The base case annual drug acquisition cost was assumed to be $56,000. Other medical and indirect costs were obtained from published literature or list prices. Utilities for patients and caregivers were obtained from the published literature and varied by AD state and care setting (community care or long-term care). We considered 3 DMT treatment strategies: (1) treatment administered until patients reached severe AD (continuous strategy), (2) treatment administered for a maximum duration of 18 months or when patients reached severe AD (fixed-duration strategy), and (3) 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months because of amyloid plaque clearance and the remaining patients continuing treatment until 18 months or until they reached severe AD (test-and-discontinue strategy). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.From the health care sector perspective, continuous treatment with a hypothetical DMT versus BSC resulted in an ICER of $612,354 per QALY gained. The ICER decreased to $157,288 per QALY gained in the fixed-duration strategy, driven by large reductions in treatment costs. With 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months (test-and-discontinue strategy), the ICER was $125,631 per QALY gained. In sensitivity and scenario analyses, the ICER was the most sensitive to changes in treatment efficacy, treatment cost, and the initial population AD state distribution. From the modified societal perspective, ICERs were 6.3%, 20.4%, and 25.1% lower than those from the health care sector perspective for the continuous, fixed-duration, and test-and-discontinue strategies, respectively.Under a set of assumptions for annual treatment costs and the magnitude and duration of treatment efficacy, DMTs used for a limited duration may deliver value consistent with accepted US cost-effectiveness thresholds.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36209950": {"ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer's disease/dementia-associated brain pathology in aging DPP6-KO mice.", "ArticleAbstract": "We have previously reported that the single transmembrane protein Dipeptidyl Peptidase Like 6 (DPP6) impacts neuronal and synaptic development.

Currently, no methodology is available to estimate neurofunctional subtypes and their associated RSNs simultaneously.We present an unsupervised learning method for fMRI data, called Clusterwise Independent Component Analysis (C-ICA). This enables the clustering of patients into neurofunctional subtypes based on differences in shared ICA-derived RSNs. The parameters are estimated simultaneously, which leads to an improved estimation of subtypes and their associated RSNs.In five simulation studies, the C-ICA model is successfully validated using both artificially and realistically simulated data (N\u00a0=\u00a030-40). The successful performance of the C-ICA model is also illustrated on an empirical data set consisting of Alzheimer's disease patients and elderly control subjects (N\u00a0=\u00a0250). C-ICA is able to uncover a meaningful clustering that partially matches (balanced accuracy = .72) the diagnostic labels and identifies differences in RSNs between the Alzheimer and control cluster.Both in the simulation study and the empirical application, C-ICA yields better results compared to competing clustering methods (i.e., a two step clustering procedure based on single subject ICA's and a Group ICA plus dual regression variant thereof) that do not simultaneously estimate a clustering and associated RSNs. Indeed, the overall mean adjusted Rand Index, a measure for cluster recovery, equals 0.65 for C-ICA and ranges from 0.27 to 0.46 for competing methods.The successful performance of C-ICA indicates that it is a promising method to extract neurofunctional subtypes from multi-subject resting state-fMRI data.

Intranasal administration of MSNs-Bi not only inhibited intestinal inflammation and reduced brain A\u03b2 burden but also improved olfactory sensitivity in APP/PS1 mice.These findings suggested that restoring the balance of the gut microbiome contributes to ameliorating cognitive impairment in AD, and that intranasal administration of MSNs-Bi may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the prevention of AD and intestinal disease.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Bifidobacterium", "Bile Acids and Salts", "Brain", "Disease Models, Animal", "Fatty Acids, Volatile", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nanoparticles", "Olfaction Disorders", "Silicon Dioxide"]}, "36207441": {"ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer's disease: insights from a network medicine perspective.", "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that currently lacks available effective therapy.

However, the translational validity of APOE4 mouse models for AD-related cognitive impairment remains to be fully determined. The present study investigated the role of both sex and genotype on learning and memory in aged, humanized APOE knock-in mice. Aged (23.27 mo \u00b1 1.21 mo; 39 male/37 female) APOE3/3, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4 mice performed a novel object recognition (NOR) assay. Task-related metrics were analyzed using two-way sex by genotype ANOVAs. Sex differences were more prominent relative to APOE genotype. Prior to NOR, female mice exhibited thigmotaxic center zone avoidance during the open field task relative to males, regardless of genotype. Within object familiarization and NOR tasks, females had greater object interaction and locomotion. Interestingly, only APOE4/4 females on average recognized the novel object. These results suggest that APOE4, although strongly related to LOAD pathogenesis, does not drive cognitive decline in the absence of other risk factors even in very aged mice. Chromosomal sex is a key driver of behavioral phenotypes and thus is a critical variable for translatability of interventions designed to preserve learning and memory in animal models of LOAD.

A huge body of literature exists on possible predictors of response, but a comprehensive review is lacking. Therefore, our aim is to perform a systematic review of the predictors of response to AChEI in neurodegenerative dementias, providing a categorization and interpretation of the results.We conducted a systematic review of the literature up to December 31st, 2021, searching five different databases and registers, including studies on rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine, with clearly defined criteria for the diagnosis of dementia and the response to AChEI therapy. Records were identified through the string: predict * AND respon * AND (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors OR donepezil OR rivastigmine OR galantamine). The results were presented narratively.We identified 1,994 records in five different databases; after exclusion of duplicates, title and abstract screening, and full-text retrieval, 122 studies were finally included.The studies show high heterogeneity in duration, response definition, drug dosage, and diagnostic criteria. Response to AChEI seems associated with correlates of cholinergic deficit (hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, substantia innominate atrophy) and preserved cholinergic neurons (faster alpha on REM sleep EEG, increased anterior frontal and parietal lobe perfusion after donepezil); white matter hyperintensities in the cholinergic pathways have shown inconsistent results. The K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase may correlate with better response in late stages of disease, while the role of polymorphisms in other genes involved in the cholinergic system is controversial. Factors related to drug availability may influence response; in particular, low serum albumin (for donepezil), CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced enzymatic activity and higher drug doses are the most consistent predictors, while AChEI concentration influence on clinical outcomes is debatable. Other predictors of response include faster disease progression, lower serum cholesterol, preserved medial temporal lobes, apathy, absence of concomitant diseases, and absence of antipsychotics.

De tidlige stadier er ofte asymptomatiske, imens senstadie AMD, som opdeles i to former, neovaskulaer AMD (nAMD) og geografisk atrofi (GA), begge udviser gradvist synstab, dog generelt med forskellig hastighed. Tidlig AMD er karakteriseret ved tilstedevaerelsen af druser og pigmentforandringer i nethinden mens nAMD og GA udviser henholdsvis karnydannelse i og atrofi af nethinden. AEtiologien er multifaktoriel og udover alder omfatter patogenesen milj\u00f8- og genetiske risikofaktorer. Forskning har specielt fokuseret p\u00e5 lokale forandringer i \u00f8jet hvor man har fundet at inflammation spiller en betydelig rolle for udviklingen af sygdommen, men flere studier tyder ogs\u00e5 p\u00e5 at systemiske forandringer og specielt systemisk inflammation spiller en vaesentlig rolle i patogenesen. De Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasier (MPNs) er en gruppe af haematologiske kraeftsygdomme med en erhvervet genetisk defekt i den tidlige pluripotente stamcelle som medf\u00f8rer en overproduktion af en eller flere af blodets modne celler. Sygdommene er fundet at udvikle sig i et biologisk kontinuum fra tidligt cancerstadie, essentiel trombocytose (ET) over polycytaemi vera (PV) og endelig til det sene myelofibrose stadie (PMF). Symptomer hos disse patienter skyldes isaer den aendrede sammensaetning af blodet, hyperviskositet, kompromitteret mikrocirkulation og nedsat vaevsgennembl\u00f8dning.

En raekke mutationer som driver MPN sygdommene er identificeret, bl.a. JAK2V617F-mutationen som medf\u00f8rer en deregulering JAK/STAT signalvejen, der bl.a. har betydning for cellers vaekst og overlevelse. Et tidligere stort registerstudie har vist at patienter med MPNs har en \u00f8get risiko for neovaskulaer AMD og et pilotstudie har vist \u00f8get forekomst af intermediaer AMD. Dette \u00f8nsker vi at unders\u00f8ge naermere i et st\u00f8rre studie i dette Ph.d.- projekt. Flere studier har ogs\u00e5 vist at kronisk inflammation spiller en vigtig rolle for b\u00e5de initiering og udvikling af den maligne celleklon hos MPNs og herfra er en \"Human Inflammationsmodel\" blevet udviklet. Siden er MPN sygdommene blevet anvendt som \"model sygdomme\" for en tilsvarende inflammationsmodel for udvikling af Alzheimers sygdom. I dette Ph.d.-projekt vil vi tilsvarende fors\u00f8ge at unders\u00f8ge systemisk inflammation i forhold til forekomst af druser. Det vil vi g\u00f8re ved at sammenligne systemiske immunologiske mark\u00f8rer som tidligere er unders\u00f8gt hos patienter med AMD og sammenligne med MPN. Specielt er vi interesseret i systemiske immunologiske forskelle p\u00e5 patienter med MPN og druser (MPNd) og MPN med normale nethinder (MPNn). Denne afhandling best\u00e5r af to overordnede studier. I Studie I, unders\u00f8gte vi forekomsten af retinale forandringer associeret med AMD hos 200 patienter med MPN (artikel I). Studie II, omhandlede immunologiske ligheder ved AMD og MPN, og var opdelt i yderligere tre delstudier hvor vi unders\u00f8gte hhv. systemiske mark\u00f8rer for inflammation, aldring og angiogenese (artikel II, III og IV). Vi unders\u00f8gte mark\u00f8rerne i fire typer af patienter: nAMD, intermediaer AMD (iAMD), MPNd og MPNn. Unders\u00f8gelsen af forskelle mellem MPNd og MPNn, vil g\u00f8re det muligt at identificere forandringer i immunsystemet som kunne vaere relevante for AMD-patogenesen. Vi vil endvidere sammenholde resultaterne for patienter med MPN med patienter som har iAMD og nAMD. I studie I (Artikel I) fandt vi at patienter med MPN har en signifikant h\u00f8jere praevalens af store druser og AMD tidligere i livet sammenlignet med estimater fra tre store befolkningsunders\u00f8gelser. Vi fandt ogs\u00e5 at forekomst af druser var associeret med h\u00f8jere neutrofil-lymfocyt ratio, hvilket indikerer et h\u00f8jere niveau af kronisk inflammation i patienterne med druser sammenlignet med dem uden druser. I studie II (Artikel II, III og IV) fandt vi flere immunologiske forskelle mellem patienter med MPNd og MPNn. Da vi unders\u00f8gte mark\u00f8rer for inflammation, fandt vi en h\u00f8jere grad af systemisk inflammation i MPNd end MPNn. Dette blev vist ved en h\u00f8jere inflammationsscore (udregnet p\u00e5 baggrund af niveauer af pro-inflammatoriske mark\u00f8rer), en h\u00f8jere neutrofil-lymfocyt ratio, samt indikationer p\u00e5 et dereguleret komplementsystem. Ved unders\u00f8gelse af aldringsmark\u00f8rer fandt vi tegn p\u00e5 accelereret immunaldring hos MPNd i forhold til MPNn, hvilket kommer til udtryk ved en st\u00f8rre procentdel af \"effector memory T celler\". Endelig fandt vi en vaesentlig lavere ekspression af CXCR3 p\u00e5 T celler og monocytter hos patienter med nAMD sammenlignet med iAMD, MPNd og MPNn. Dette er i overensstemmelse med tidligere studier hvor CXCR3 ekspression er fundet lavere end hos raske kontroller. Derudover fandt vi en faldende CXCR3 ekspression p\u00e5 monocytter over det biologiske MPN-kontinuum. Disse studier indikerer en involvering af CXCR3 i b\u00e5de nAMD og PMF, begge sygdomsstadier som er karakteriseret ved angiogenese og fibrose. Ud fra resultaterne af denne afhandling kan vi konkludere at forekomsten af druser og AMD hos MPN er \u00f8get i forhold til baggrundsbefolkningen. Endvidere viser vores resultater at systemisk inflammation muligvis spiller en vaesentlig st\u00f8rre rolle i udviklingen af AMD end tidligere antaget. Vi foresl\u00e5r derfor en AMD-model (Figur 18) hvor inflammation kan initiere og accelerere den normale aldersafhaengige akkumulation af affaldsstoffer i nethinden, som senere udvikler sig til druser, medf\u00f8rende \u00f8get lokal inflammation og med tiden tidlig og intermediaer AMD. Dette resulterer i den \u00f8gede risiko for udvikling til de invaliderende senstadier af AMD. ENGLISH SUMMARY: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness in high-income countries. It is a progressive retinal disease leading to damage of the cells responsible for central vision. The early stages of the disease are often asymptomatic, while late-stage AMD, which is divided into two entities, neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy (GA), both show vision loss, though generally with different progression rates. Drusen and pigmentary abnormalities in the retina characterise early AMD, while nAMD and GA show angiogenesis in and atrophy of the retina, respectively. The aetiology is multifactorial and, in addition to ageing, which is the most significant risk factor for developing AMD, environmental- and genetic risk factors are implicated in the pathogenesis. Research has focused on local changes in the eye where inflammation has been found to play an essential role, but studies also point to systemic alterations and especially systemic inflammation to be involved in the pathogenesis. The Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of haematological cancers with an acquired genetic defect of the pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell, characterised by excess haematopoiesis of the myeloid cell lineage. The diseases have been found to evolve in a biological continuum from early cancer state, essential thrombocythemia, over polycythaemia vera (PV), to the advanced myelofibrosis stage (PMF). The symptoms in these patients are often a result of the changes in the blood composition, hyperviscosity, microvascular disturbances, and reduced tissue perfusion. The major causes of morbidity and mortality are thromboembolic- and haemorrhagic events, and leukemic transformation. A group of mutations that drive the MPNs has been identified, e.g., the JAK2V617F mutation, which results in deregulation of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway important, for instance, in cell differentiation and survival. A previous large register study has shown that patients with MPNs have an increased risk of neovascular AMD, and a pilot study has shown an increased prevalence of intermediate AMD. We wish to study this further in a larger scale study. Several studies have also shown that systemic inflammation plays an essential role in both the initiation and progression of the malignant cell clone in MPNs. From this knowledge, a \"Human inflammation model\" has been developed. Since then, the MPNs has been used as model diseases for a similar inflammation model for the development of Alzheimer's disease. In this PhD project, we would like to investigate systemic inflammation in relation to drusen presence. We will do this by comparing systemic immunological markers previously investigated in patients with AMD and compare with MPN. We are primarily interested in systemic immunological differences between patients with MPN and drusen (MPNd) and MPN with normal retinas (MPNn). This thesis consists of two main studies. Study I investigated the prevalence of retinal changes associated with AMD and the prevalence of different AMD stages in 200 patients with MPN (paper I). Study II examined immunological similarities between AMD and MPNs. This study was divided into three substudies exploring systemic markers of inflammation, ageing and angiogenesis, respectively. This was done in four types of patients: nAMD, intermediate AMD (iAMD), MPNd and MPNn. Investigating, differences between MPNd and MPNn, will make it possible to identify changes in the immune system, relevant for AMD pathogenesis. Additionally, we will compare patients with MPNs with patients with iAMD and nAMD. In study I (Paper I), we found that patients with MPNs have a significantly higher prevalence of large drusen and consequently AMD from an earlier age compared to the estimates from three large population-based studies. We also found that drusen prevalence was associated with a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio indicating a higher level of chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with drusen compared to those without drusen. In study II (papers II, III and IV), we found immunological differences between patients with MPNd and MPNn. When we investigated markers of inflammation, we found a higher level of systemic inflammation in MPNd than MPNn. This was indicated by a higher inflammation score (based on levels of pro-inflammatory markers), a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and indications of a deregulated complement system. When examining markers of ageing, we found signs of accelerated immune ageing in MPNd compared to MPNn, shown by more senescent effector memory T cells. Finally, when exploring a marker of angiogenesis, we found a lower CXCR3 expression on monocytes and T cells in nAMD compared to iAMD, MPNd and MPNn, in line with previous studies of nAMD compared to healthy controls. Further, we found decreasing CXCR3 expression over the MPN biological continuum. These studies indicate CXCR3 involvement in both nAMD and PMF, two disease stages characterised by angiogenesis and fibrosis. From the results of this PhD project, we can conclude that the prevalence of drusen and AMD is increased in patients with MPN compared to the general population. Further, our results show that systemic inflammation may play a far more essential role in AMD pathogenesis than previously anticipated. We, therefore, propose an AMD model (Figure\u00a018) where inflammation can initiate and accelerate the normal age-dependent accumulation of debris in the retina, which later evolve into drusen, resulting in increased local inflammation, and over time early- and intermediate AMD. This results in the increased risk of developing the late debilitating stages of AMD.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Animals", "DEET", "Dogs", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Neoplasms", "Pilot Projects", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Visual Acuity", "Wet Macular Degeneration"]}, "36200249": {"ArticleTitle": "Evaluation of the mechanism of action of rosemary volatile oil in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and network pharmacology.", "ArticleAbstract": "Objective The aim of our study was to investigate the active components and mechanism of action of rosemary volatile oil for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) using network pharmacology. Methods We obtained the constituents of the rosemary volatile oil by searching Chinese herbal systemic pharmacological databases and analytical platforms, and we constructed the constituent-target networks by predicting and screening the action targets of the rosemary volatile oil constituents using SwissTargetPrediction, metaTarFisher, and Pubchem. We obtained the AD-related targets using the Genecards, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases, and we constructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) using the STRING database in Venny 2.1.0 graph to screen the cross-targets by screening the core-acting targets. Cytoscape 3.8.2 software was used to construct a component-target-pathway network to screen the potential active components of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD and to predict the mechanism of action of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD in combination with existing pharmacological studies. We performed a gene ontology (GO) biological process and a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the targets of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD using R language and molecular docking using Discovery Studio 4.0 software to validate their biological activities. Results A network constructed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 26 potential active ingredients in the rosemary volatile oil. We retrieved a total of 10762 AD targets from Genecards and other used databases. Our GO enrichment analysis yielded 39 entries (P < 0.05), including 14 entries for biological processes, five entries for cellular composition, and 20 entries for molecular function. A total of 14 entries (P < 0.05) were then enriched in the KEGG pathway that primarily involved the IL-17 signaling pathway and the AGE-RAGE pathway.

These typically included age, APOE, and a blood pressure-related measure. The neurofibrillary tangle and micro-vascular lesion models showed good accuracy for predicting clinical vascular dementia.There may be shared risk factors across dementia-related lesions, suggesting common pathways. Strategies targeting these models may reduce risk or postpone clinical symptoms of dementia as well as reduce neuropathological burden associated with AD and vascular lesions.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36193827": {"ArticleTitle": "Digital culturally tailored marketing for enrolling Latino participants in a web-based registry: Baseline metrics from the Brain Health Registry.", "ArticleAbstract": "This culturally tailored enrollment effort aims to determine the feasibility of enrolling 5000 older Latino adults from California into the Brain Health Registries (BHR) over 2.25 years.This paper describes (1) the development and deployment of culturally tailored BHR websites and digital ads, in collaboration with a Latino community science partnership board and a marketing company; (2) an interim feasibility analysis of the enrollment efforts and numbers, and participant characteristics (primary aim); as well as (3) an exploration of module completion and a preliminary efficacy evaluation of the culturally tailored digital efforts compared to BHR's standard non-culturally tailored efforts (secondary aim).In 12.5 months, 3603 older Latino adults were enrolled (71% of the total California Latino BHR initiative enrollment goal).

Petasites japonicus is known for its beneficial effects on various disease states such as allergic reaction, oxidative stress and inflammation. However, it is still unknown whether P. japonicus has protective effects on neuroinflammation, especially microgliosis related to AD. The current study aimed to investigate whether an extract of P. japonicus (named KP-1) protects from microglial cell activation in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the anti-neuroinflammation effects of KP-1, the current study adopted the most widely used experimental models including the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microgliosis in vitro model and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) oligomer (A\u03b2O)-induced neuroinflammation in vivo model, respectively. As a result, KP-1 pre-treatment reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, protein levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in BV2 cells which were significantly promoted by 100 ng ml-1 LPS treatment. Similarly, KP-1 administration protected mice from A\u03b2O-induced memory impairment scored by Y-maze and novel object recognition test (NORT). Moreover, KP-1 administration suppressed A\u03b2O-induced microglial cell activation measured by counting the number of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive cells in both the cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus and measuring the mRNA expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Furthermore, A\u03b2O-induced synaptotoxicity was prevented by KP-1 administration which is in line with behavioral changes.

They have many important functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including the maintenance of glutamate and ion homeostasis, the elimination of oxidative stress, energy storage in glycogen, tissue repair, regulating synaptic activity by releasing neurotransmitters, and participating in synaptic formation. Astrocytes have special highly ramified structure. Their branches contact with synapses of neurons inwardly, with fine structure and wrapping synapses; their feet contact with blood vessels of brain parenchyma outward, almost wrapping the whole brain. The adjacent astrocytes rarely overlap and communicate with each other through gap junction channels. The ideal location of astrocytes enables them to sense the weak changes of their surroundings and provide the structural basis for the energy supply of neurons. Neurons and astrocytes are closely coupled units of energy metabolism in the brain. Neurons consume a lot of ATPs in the process of neurotransmission. Astrocytes provide metabolic substrates for neurons, maintain high activity of neuron, and facilitate information transmission of neurons. This article reviews the characteristics of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism of astrocytes.

However, brains from individuals clinically diagnosed with \"AD-type\" (amnestic) dementia usually harbor heterogeneous neuropathologies in addition to, or other than, ADNC. We hypothesized that some AD-type dementia associated genetic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified from large genomewide association studies (GWAS) were associated with non-ADNC neuropathologies. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from multiple studies with available genotype and neuropathologic phenotype information. Clinical AD/dementia risk alleles of interest were derived from the very large GWAS by Bellenguez et al. (2022) who reported 83 clinical AD/dementia-linked SNVs in addition to the APOE risk alleles. To query the pathologic phenotypes associated with variation of those SNVs, National Alzheimer's disease Coordinating Center (NACC) neuropathologic data were linked to AD Sequencing Project (ADSP) and AD Genomics Consortium (ADGC) data. Separate data were obtained from the harmonized Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). A total of 4811 European participants had at least ADNC neuropathology data and also genotype data available; data were meta-analyzed across cohorts. As expected, a subset of dementia-associated SNVs were associated with ADNC risk in Europeans-e.g., BIN1, PICALM, CR1, MME, and COX7C. Other gene variants linked to (clinical) AD dementia were associated with non-ADNC pathologies. For example, the associations of GRN and TMEM106B SNVs with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) were replicated. In addition, SNVs in TNIP1 and WNT3 previously reported as AD-related were instead associated with hippocampal sclerosis pathology. Some genotype/neuropathology association trends were not statistically significant at P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 after correcting for multiple testing, but were intriguing.

The median (range) age of participants was 75 (65-105) years; 8769 participants (51.3%) were female and 8338 (48.7%) were male. In the optimal 1:1 matching analysis (n\u2009=\u20093154), White participants had a greater proportion of positive amyloid PET scans compared with Asian participants (181 of 313; 57.8%; 95% CI, 52.3-63.2 vs 142 of 313; 45.4%; 95% CI, 39.9-50.9, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and Hispanic participants (482 of 780; 61.8%; 95% CI, 58.3-65.1 vs 425 of 780; 54.5%; 95% CI, 51.0-58.0, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.003) but not Black participants (359 of 615; 58.4%; 95% CI, 54.4-62.2 vs 333 of 615; 54.1%; 95% CI, 50.2-58.0, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.13). In the adjusted model, the odds of having a positive amyloid PET scan were lower for Asian participants (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.37-0.59; P\u2009<\u2009.001), Black participants (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and Hispanic participants (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.79; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with White participants.Racial and ethnic differences found in amyloid PET positivity among individuals with MCI and dementia in this study may indicate differences in underlying etiology of cognitive impairment and guide future treatment and prevention approaches.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36190701": {"ArticleTitle": "Cost-effectiveness of Aducanumab and Donanemab for Early Alzheimer Disease-Estimating the True Value.", "ArticleAbstract": "", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36190693": {"ArticleTitle": "Heat Shock-Induced Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Neural Stem Cells Confer Marked Neuroprotection Against Oxidative Stress and Amyloid-\u03b2-Caused Neurotoxicity.", "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and a leading cause of dementia. Although the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide is deemed a crucial driver of AD, there are no effective therapeutics available to treat A\u03b2-caused neurotoxicity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound small particles mediating intercellular traffic of nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and metabolites. Exosomes are a subtype of EVs with a size range of 30-150\u00a0nm in diameter. Stem cell-derived EVs are a potential therapeutic for AD, while EVs isolated from normal stem cell cultures generally have a low yield. Here, we studied the EVs secreted by the rat neural stem cells in the presence of heat shock (HS) stimulus. Nanoparticle tracking analysis confirmed that HS-derived EVs exhibit significantly higher concentration and larger diameter in comparison to the non-heat shock (NHS)-derived EVs. Mass spectrometric studies of EV proteins revealed that HS-derived EVs contained fewer diverse proteins than NHS-derived exosomes. GO enrichment analysis of the proteins suggested that the top two biological functions of the proteins in HS-derived EVs are involved in the negative regulation of apoptotic process and positive modulation of DNA repair. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of the NHS- and HS-derived EVs were tested in a cell culture model of AD: HS-derived EVs exhibited greater neuroprotection against not only oxidative stress but also amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced neurotoxicity compared to NHS-derived EVs. Moreover, HS-derived EVs were also able to dramatically attenuate A\u03b2-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. These data indicate that in response to HS, neural stem cells increase EV production and alter EV morphology and cargo to confer better neuroprotection against oxidative stress and A\u03b2-caused neurotoxicity, suggesting that HS-induced EVs from neural stem cells can be a therapeutic agent for AD and possibly other neurological disorders.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Animals", "Rats", "Neuroprotection", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Extracellular Vesicles", "Alzheimer Disease", "Oxidative Stress", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurotoxicity Syndromes"]}, "36190126": {"ArticleTitle": "Recent advances in small molecular near-infrared fluorescence probes for a targeted diagnosis of the Alzheimer disease.", "ArticleAbstract": "Nowadays, it is still quite challenging to achieve an early diagnosis of the Alzheimer disease (AD) in clinics.

Additionally, abnormal protein accumulation due to autophagic deficiency may also be involved in disease progression. Autophagy involves a mechanism called selective autophagy. However, the relationship between selective autophagy and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the interaction between p62, an adapter protein, and an APP-related molecule, and found that p62 interacted with the C-terminal fragment of APP (C60). When C60 and p62 are overexpressed, aggregates are formed, and C60 is degraded by autophagy. These aggregates cannot be easily degraded, even with a reducing agent. We also found that autophagosome- and lysosome-marker-positive vesicles were formed in the C60- and p62-expressing cells. Super resolution technology also revealed that p62-C60-positive autophagosomes were formed in the cells. Overall, these results suggest that p62 may bind with C60 to form aggregates and induce autophagy in autophagosomes.

Investigators often use DRE in research. When participants ask for their personal results, investigators have concerns. Will data that was intended to study groups be valid for individuals? Will sharing data cause distress? Debates around sharing DRE became heated when blood-based amyloid tests and amyloid reducing drugs appeared poised to enable clinicians easily to identify people with elevated brain amyloid and reduce it with a drug. Such an approach would transform the traditional role of DRE from investigational to foundational; however, then the high costs, uncertain clinical benefits and risks of the therapy led to an urgent need for education to support clinical decision making. Further complicating DRE use are direct to consumer genetic testing and increasingly available biomarker testing. Withholding DRE becomes less feasible and public education around responsible use and understanding become vital. A critical answer to these legal and ethical issues is supporting education that clearly delineates known risks, benefits, and gaps in knowledge, and communication to promote understanding among researchers, clinicians, patients, and all stakeholders.

More than one third of patients with COVID-19 develop neurologic problems during the acute phase of the illness, including loss of sense of smell or taste, seizures, and stroke. Damage or functional changes to the brain may result in chronic sequelae. The risk of incident cognitive and neuropsychiatric complications appears independent from the severity of the original pulmonary illness. It behooves the scientific and medical community to attempt to understand the molecular and/or systemic factors linking COVID-19 to neurologic illness, both short and long term.This article describes what is known so far in terms of links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias.

Conclusions from subcommittees were presented to the whole group and discussed extensively. Presently data collection is ongoing at 19 sites in 12 countries representing Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe.The Alzheimer's Association Global Consortium harmonized methodology is proposed as a model to study long-term neurocognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The following review describes what is known so far in terms of molecular and epidemiological links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and AD and related dementias (ADRD)The primary objective of this large-scale collaboration is to clarify the pathogenesis of ADRD and to advance our understanding of the impact of a neurotropic virus on the long-term risk of cognitive decline and other CNS sequelae. No available evidence supports the notion that cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a form of dementia (ADRD or otherwise). The longitudinal methodologies espoused by the consortium are intended to provide data to answer this question as clearly as possible controlling for possible confounders. Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.The proposed harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology, determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and vascular disease.We provide a framework for current and future studies to be carried out within the Consortium. and offers a \"green paper\" to the research community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low- and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data on the topic.The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19 neuropsychiatric sequelae.

Part 1: Meta-analysis and review of efficacy and safety data, and medico-economical aspects.", "ArticleAbstract": "In 2021, aducanumab, an immunotherapy targeting amyloid-\u03b2, was approved for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the US Food and Drug Administration thanks to positive results on a putative biological surrogate marker. This approval has raised an unprecedented controversy. It was followed by a refusal of the European Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials. Compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, the common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid immunotherapies is their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients. Here, we review the available evidence regarding efficacy and safety data and medico-economical aspects for high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies. We also perform frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy and safety of the highest dose groups from the two aducanumab phase 3 trials and the donanemab and lecanemab phase 2 trials. When pooled together, the data from high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies trials confirm a statistically significant clinical effect of these drugs on cognitive decline after 18 months (difference in cognitive decline measured with CDR-SB after 18 months between the high dose immunotherapy groups vs. placebo\u00a0=\u00a0-0.24 points; P=0.04, frequentist random-effect model), with results on ADAS-Cog being the most statistically robust. However, this effect remains below the previously established minimal clinically relevant values. In parallel, the drugs significantly increased the occurrence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E: risk ratio=13.39; P<0.0001), ARIA-hemorrhage (risk ratio=2.78; P=0.0002), and symptomatic and serious ARIA (7/1321=0.53% in the high dose groups versus 0/1446 in the placebo groups; risk ratio=6.44; P=0.04). The risk/benefit ratio of high-clearance immunotherapies in early AD is so far questionable after 18 months. Identifying subgroups of better responders, the perspective of combination therapies, and a longer follow-up may help improve their clinical relevance. Finally, the preliminary evidence from medico-economical analyses seems to indicate that the current cost of aducanumab in the US is not in reasonable alignment with its clinical benefits.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36184116": {"ArticleTitle": "Estrogen and dementia.", "ArticleAbstract": "", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Dementia", "Estrogen Replacement Therapy", "Estrogens", "Female", "Humans"]}, "36183950": {"ArticleTitle": "A review: Pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of aminoalcohol-diterpenoid alkaloids from Aconitum species.", "ArticleAbstract": "Aconitum medicinal materials, such as Aconitum carmichaelii Debeaux (Chinese: Wutou/) and Aconitum kusnezoffii Reichb.

Statistics show that there are over 600 efficient TCM formulations comprising Aconitum medicinal materials. But high toxicity limits their clinical application. Clinically, the Aconitum medicinal materials must undergo a complex processing process that includes soaking, steaming, and boiling with pharmaceutical excipients, which makes highly toxic ester diterpenoid alkaloids are hydrolyzed to form less toxic aminoalcohol-diterpenoid alkaloids (ADAs).This review aims to summarize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological activities of low-toxicity ADAs, providing a reference for future ADAs research and drug development.Accessible literature on ADAs published between 1984 and 2022 were screened and obtained from available electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct and Google Scholar, followed by systematic analysis.ADAs are secondary products of plant metabolism, widely distributed in the Aconitum species and Delphinium species. The toxicity of ADAs as pharmacodynamic components of Aconitum medicinal materials is much lower than that of other diterpenoid alkaloids due to the absence of ester bonds. On the one hand, the pharmacokinetics of ADAs have received little attention compared to other toxic alkaloids. The research primarily focuses on aconine and mesaconine. According to existing studies, ADAs absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is primarily passive with a short Tmax. Simultaneously, efflux transporters have less impact on ADAs absorption than non-ADAs. After entering the body, ADAs are widely distributed in the heart, liver, lungs, and kidney, but less in the brain. Notably, aconine is not well metabolized by liver microsomes. Aconine and mesaconine are excreted in urine and feces, respectively. ADAs, on the other hand, have been shown to have a variety of pharmacological activities, including cardiac, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and regenerative effects via regulating multiple signaling pathways, including Nrf2/ARE, PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/Chop, ERK/CREB, NF-\u03baB, Bcl-2/Bax, and GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways.ADAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on heart disease, neurological disease, and other systemic diseases.

Treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and H2S donors such as sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) can reduce oxidative stress in preclinical studies, however clinical benefits of such treatments are rather ambiguous. This is partly due to poor stability and bioavailability of the H2S donors, requiring impractically large doses that are associated with dose-limiting toxicity. Herein, we identified a bioavailable 3-mercaptopyruvate prodrug, sulfanegen, which is able to pose as a sacrificial redox substrate for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), one of the H2S biosynthetic enzymes in the brain. Sulfanegen is able to mitigate toxicity emanating from oxidative insults and the A\u03b21-42 peptide by releasing H2S through the 3MST pathway. When administered to symptomatic transgenic mouse model of AD (APP/PS1; 7 and 12 months) and mice that were intracerebroventricularly administered with the A\u03b21-42 peptide, sulfanegen was able to reverse oxidative and neuroinflammatory consequences of AD pathology by restoring 3MST function. Quantitative neuropathological analyses confirmed significant disease modifying effect of the compound on amyloid plaque burden and brain inflammatory markers. More importantly, sulfanegen treatment attenuated progressive neurodegeneration in these mice, as evident from the restoration of TH+\u00a0neurons in the locus coeruleus. This study demonstrates a previously unknown concept that supplementation of 3MST function in the brain may be a viable approach for the management of AD.

The prevalence of dementia increases with aging, and the underlying pathophysiological processes in the preclinical phase begin even before cognitive deficits or neurological signs appear. SD may be either a risk factor for developing dementia or a prodromal stage of dementia. The inconsistent findings regarding the association between SD and incident dementia may be attributable to the neuropathological heterogeneity underlying SD. Most studies have focused on patients with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) as an outcome, but several clinicopathological studies suggest that primary age-related tauopathy and argyrophilic grain disease may account for a proportion of cases clinically misdiagnosed as AD in the elderly population. Furthermore, most AD cases have additional neuropathologic changes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease.

There is not yet adequate legal protection for the growing number of individuals with preclinical AD.

Authors argue that these cases may provide a unique body of evidence, so-called 'artistic signatures' of neurodegenerative diseases, that might be used to understand disorders, provide diagnoses, be employed in treatment, create patterns of testable hypotheses for causative study, and also provide unique insight into the neurobiological linkages between the mind, brain, body, and the human penchant for art-making itself. However-before we can begin to meaningfully build from such emerging findings, much less formulate applications-not only is such evidence currently quite disparate and in need of systematic review, almost all case reports and artwork ratings are entirely subjective, based on authors' personal observations or a sparse collection of methods that may not best fit underlying research aims. This leads to the very real question of whether we might actually find patterns of systematic change if fit to a rigorous review-Can we really 'read' art to illuminate possible changes in the brain? How might we best approach this topic in future neuroscientific, clinical, and art-related research? This paper presents a review of this field and answer to these questions. We consider the current case reports for seven main disorders-Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia, corticobasal degeneration, aphasia, as well as stroke-consolidating arguments for factors and changes related to art-making and critiquing past methods. Taking the published artworks from these papers, we then conduct our own assessment, employing computerized and human-rater-based approaches, which we argue represent best practice to identify stylistic or creativity/quality changes. We suggest, indeed, some evidence for systematic patterns in art-making for specific disorders and also find that case authors showed rather high agreement with our own assessments.

The combination of poor sleep and diet health may increase risk for dementia in people with MCI, yet it is unknown how intervening on diet may influence sleep health.The MCI Sleep Study assesses longitudinal changes in objective and subjective measures of sleep between two investigational diet groups in the Brain Energy for Amyloid Transformation in Alzheimer's Disease study: the modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet. Objective sleep assessments include an in-home sleep study using the WatchPAT Central Plus (Itamar Medical, Ltd) at baseline and the end of the 4-month diet intervention. Subjective sleep questionnaires include the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The MCI Sleep Study outcome measures include longitudinal change in cognitive performance, mood, behavior, and quality of life.Study recruitment is currently ongoing.

Rifampicin (RIF) is a semi-synthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic with anti-\u03b2-amyloid deposition, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, and neuroprotective effects, but its application in AD treatment has been limited for its strong hydrophobicity, high toxicity, short half-life, low bioavailability, and blood-brain barrier hindrance. We designed a novel brain-targeted and MRI-characteristic nanomedicine via loading rabies virus protein 29 (RVG29), rifampicin, and Gd on poly (l-lactide) nanoparticles (RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29). The cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 had favorable biocompatibility and security. Fluorescence imaging in vivo showed that PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 could deliver rifampicin into the brain by enhancing cellular uptake and brain targeting performance, leading to improvement of the bioavailability of rifampicin.

The purpose of our study is to identify multimodal imaging-driven subtypes in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) participants using a multiview learning framework based on Deep Generalized Canonical\u00a0Correlation\u00a0Analysis (DGCCA), to learn shared latent representation with low dimensions from 3 neuroimaging modalities.DGCCA applies non-linear transformation to input views using neural networks and is able to learn correlated\u00a0embeddings with low dimensions that capture more variance than its linear counterpart, generalized CCA (GCCA). We designed experiments to compare DGCCA embeddings with single modality features and GCCA embeddings by generating 2 subtypes from each feature set using unsupervised clustering. In our validation studies, we found that amyloid PET imaging has the most discriminative features compared with structural MRI and FDG PET which DGCCA learns from but not GCCA. DGCCA subtypes show differential measures in 5 cognitive assessments, 6 brain volume measures, and conversion to AD patterns. In addition, DGCCA MCI subtypes confirmed AD genetic markers with strong signals that existing late MCI group did not identify.Overall, DGCCA is able to learn effective low dimensional embeddings from multimodal data by learning non-linear projections. MCI subtypes generated from DGCCA embeddings are different from existing early and late MCI groups and show most similarity with those identified by amyloid PET features. In our validation studies, DGCCA subtypes show distinct patterns in cognitive measures, brain volumes, and are able to identify AD genetic markers. These findings indicate the promise of the imaging-driven subtypes and their power in revealing disease structures beyond early and late stage MCI.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Arachnodactyly", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Contracture", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Genetic Markers", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography"]}, "36175849": {"ArticleTitle": "Clinical impact of microbleeds in patients with Alzheimer's disease.", "ArticleAbstract": "Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are more frequent in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) than in the general population.

The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a visual assessment method that provides both an overall assessment of brain tauopathy and regional characterization of abnormal tau deposition. Methods: 18-F MK-6240 scans from 102 participants (including healthy volunteers, patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders) were reviewed by an expert nuclear medicine physician blind to participants' diagnosis to identify common patterns of brain uptake. This initial visual read method was field tested in a separate, non-overlapping cohort of 102 participants with 2 additional na\u00efve readers trained on the method. Visual read outcomes were compared with semiquantitative assessments using volume of interest (VOI) SUVr. Results: For the visual read eight gray-matter regions per hemisphere were assessed as negative (no abnormal uptake) or positive (1-25% of the region involved, 25-75% involvement, or >75% involvement), then characterized the tau binding pattern as positive or negative for evidence of tau, and if positive, whether brain uptake is in an AD pattern.

Furthermore, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to detect alteration of intestinal structure of mice, cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, and APP process of brain and colon in each group.A\u03b21-42 i.c.v induced cognitive impairment and neuron damage in the brain of\u00a0 mice. At the same time, A\u03b21-42 i.c.v induced alteration of gut microbiota at 4\u00a0weeks after surgery, while there was no difference at the baseline and 2\u00a0weeks after surgery. In addition, changes in colon structure and increased levels of pro-inflammatory factors were detected in A\u03b21-42 treatment group, accompanied by inhibition of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways. Amyloidogenic pathways in both the brain and colon were accelerated in A\u03b21-42 treatment group.The present findings suggested that A\u03b2 in the CNS can induce gut microbiota dysbiosis, alter intestinal structure and accelerate the amyloidogenic pathways, which were related to inhibiting cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "DNA, Ribosomal", "Dysbiosis", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Lateral Ventricles", "Mice", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neuroimmunomodulation"]}, "36171428": {"ArticleTitle": "The three-dimensional landscape of cortical chromatin accessibility in Alzheimer's disease.", "ArticleAbstract": "To characterize the dysregulation of chromatin accessibility in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we generated 636 ATAC-seq libraries from neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei isolated from the superior temporal gyrus and entorhinal cortex of 153 AD cases and 56 controls.

Little is known about the extent to which targetable pathogenic mechanisms are shared among these seemingly diverse diseases. Translational control is critical for maintaining proteostasis during aging. Gaining control of the translation machinery is also crucial in the battle between viruses and their hosts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that overexpression of SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) robustly rescued neuromuscular degeneration and behavioral phenotypes in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These diseases share a common mechanism: the accumulation of aberrant protein species due to the stalling and collision of translating ribosomes, leading to proteostasis failure. Our genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that Nsp1 acted in a multipronged manner to resolve collided ribosomes, abort stalled translation, and remove faulty translation products causative of disease in these models, at least in part through the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, ribosome-associated quality-control factors, autophagy, and AKT signaling. Nsp1 exhibited exquisite specificity in its action, as it did not modify other neurodegenerative conditions not known to be associated with ribosome stalling.

Numerous examples, however, demonstrated that drug efficacy does not always depend only on binding affinity but positively correlates with binding kinetics, that is, the dissociation rate constant (koff). Binding free energy landscape (BFEL) constructor is a computational binding kinetics prediction method, previously developed by us, that estimates the binding kinetics for ligand-protein based on their constructed binding free energy landscape, but it also reveals the detailed molecular mechanism of the binding event, hence, providing the position of transition states at the molecular level to modify/improve the binding kinetics. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a well-known Alzheimer's disease (AD) target for which there is still not an ideal drug on the market. Therefore, to improve the drug design strategy for AD, the binding kinetics and binding molecular mechanisms of the four inhibitors of AChE, that is, E2020 (Aricept), HupA, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine, were studied. Also, the differentiation of the binding kinetics between mAChE and TcAChE was studied to evaluate the sensitiveness of BFEL constructor. The flexibility of molecules has a noticeable effect on the nature of BFEL. To the same target, flexible molecules (i.e., E2020 and Rivastigmine) which contain more rotatable bonds tend to have more complicated BFELs reflecting more complicated molecular action mechanisms than the rigid ones (i.e., HupA and Galantamine), which therefore could be more challenging to be optimized. The binding kinetics is highly dependent on the structure of the molecules, such as the length and the functional groups. Therefore, E2020 presents better binding kinetic and thermodynamic properties with either TcAChE or mAChE. Therefore, it is the most promising lead drug for binding kinetics-based drug design. In addition, the binding kinetics of a drug may present different values in the proteins of different organisms because the residue compositions of the binding gorges of the targets are variant, that is, E2020 shows lower binding affinity and association energy barrier in binding with mAChE than TcAChE.

The effects of nutraceuticals cannot be ignored; it is important to investigate high-quality clinical trials. Given the potential of nutraceuticals to battle AD as multi-targeted therapies, it's vital to evaluate them as viable lead compounds for drug discovery and development. To the best of the authors 'knowledge, modification of blood-brain barrier permeability, bioavailability, and aspects of randomized clinical trials should be considered in prospective investigations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Advancements in molecular diagnostic and fundamentals have implemented particular usefulness for drug evaluation. An excess of experimental knowledge occurs regarding the effect of nutraceuticals on AD. There are various preclinical and clinical studies that have been done on nutraceuticals. In addition, various substitute inhibit and enhance some pathophysiological levels associated with AD. Nutraceuticals are easily available and have fewer side effects with cost-effective advantages. However, further investigations and clinical trials are required to encourage its effect on disease.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": []}, "36168697": {"ArticleTitle": "[The possibilities of differential diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia].", "ArticleAbstract": "The authors describe a clinical case demonstrating the difficulties of diagnosing primary progressive aphasia, the need for a differential diagnosis with a logopenic variant of Alzheimer's disease.

Deposits of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) were also found in the retina of AD patients. At the same time, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) occupies the first place among geronto-ophthalmic pathologies in patients with AD. POAG, like AD, is a neurodegenerative disease. AD and POAG have common symptoms, and therefore several common principles for their early diagnosis can be developed. Therefore, a promising direction is the search for biomarkers for the early detection of AD and POAG. Currently, the diagnosis of early AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and biomarkers in the brain (imaging of amyloid plaques and tau positron emission tomography) are well studied, while data in literature on using these biomarkers in patients with POAG is scarce. However, the above diagnostic methods are not considered in routine clinical practice due to their invasiveness and high cost. There is a growing need for conventional, affordable biomarkers for AD and POAG, as it is necessary to start treatment of prodromal conditions from symptoms to onset of symptoms. In this connection, biomarkers such as A\u03b2 and tau protein in blood serum and plasma are actively evaluated in patients with AD. In patients with POAG, there is no published data on studies of these biomarkers, which requires scientific research. Many authors discover the role of sirtuins (SIRT) in aging and age-related diseases, such as AD, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and others. Possibly, SIRT could become potential biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases.\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430

Despite the high clinical prevalence of sleep disturbances in LBD, they are under-studied relative to other dementias. The aim of the present systematic review was to examine the nature of sleep disturbances in LBD, summarise the effect of treatment studies upon sleep, and highlight specific and necessary directions for future research.Published studies in English were located by searching PubMED and PSYCArticles databases (until 10 June 2022).

Recent evidence has indicated that elderly people with dementia are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and severe disease outcomes. However, its molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we retrieved frontal cortex samples of COVID-19 patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus\u00a0database and performed a systematic transcriptomic analysis to compare COVID-19 patients and controls with or without dementia. In nondemented patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection obviously activated T helper type 2 (Th2) cell-mediated humoral immunity and reduced the pathogenesis of dementia-related Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In demented patients, conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased T helper type 1 (Th1) cell-mediated cellular immunity and exacerbated the progression of dementia-related diseases. We further analyzed the molecular characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without dementia. Compared with nondemented COVID-19 patients, demented COVID-19 patients showed decreased enrichment scores of Calcium signaling pathway, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, ABC transporters, and Peroxisome, and increased enrichment scores of Olfactory transduction and Regulation of autophagy. The ratio of Th1/Th2 cells was significantly increased from 1.17 in nondemented COVID-19 patients to 33.32 in demented COVID-19 patients.

Conventional endpoints, such as cognitive tests or clinical rating scores, may lack the sensitivity to subtle treatment effects in participants with MCI. Therefore, there is an immediate need to refocus on direct physiological assessments to detect the effects of ChEIs in patients with MCI due to AD.We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of donepezil, a ChEI, on patients with MCI due to AD. We plan to recruit 78 participants (39 in each arm) with MCI who had amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)-positive results for this open-label study. To evaluate subtle differences, we will measure eye-tracking metrics and digital pen data while participants perform the simplified Rey Complex Figure (RCFT) and clock drawing tests. The primary outcome is a change in the ratio of the number of fixations (working space/perceptual space) performed using the simplified RCFT, from baseline to 12\u00a0weeks, as assessed using eye-tracking metrics. The secondary outcomes are changes in general cognition, clinical severity, activities of daily living, and visuospatial function assessed using standard rating scores and digital pen data. The analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be based on the difference in changes during follow-up between the donepezil and control groups using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as well as adjusting for baseline values.This study is designed to determine whether eye-tracking metrics can detect the effect of donepezil on visuospatial dysfunction more sensitively in patients with MCI.

To provide novel insights into the roles of dark microglia during aging in the context of AD pathology, we performed a quantitative density and ultrastructural analysis of these cells using high-throughput scanning electron microscopy in the ventral hippocampus CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare of 20-month-old APP-PS1 vs C57BL/6J male mice. The density of dark microglia was significantly higher in APP-PS1 vs C57BL/6J mice, with these cells accounting for nearly half of all microglia observed near amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques.

The present work aimed to improve the AChE inhibition activity of the caffeine. The rationally designed caffeine-based triazoles were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for cholinesterase and \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) inhibitory activities.

Thus, this study aimed to explore whether there are causal associations of genetically predicted PD and AD with IBD, using a two-sample MR study.Summary statistics for IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, which included the International IBD Genetics Consortium and the UK IBD Genetics Consortium (n=59,957). Genetic variants associated with the largest meta-analysis of GWAS of PD (n=1,474,097) and AD (n=455,258) were used as instrumental variables. We used multiple methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and Robust Adjusted Profile Score (RAPS) methods, to estimate the effects of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD. To confirm the validity of the analysis, we also evaluated the pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis that drive causal associations.The results of the IVW method, WM, and RAPS showed that genetically predicted PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of UC (odds ratio [OR]IVW=1.068, OR WM=1.107, OR RAPS=1.069, all P<0.05).

The diversity of factors associated with AD pathogenesis, coupled with age-associated damage, suggests that a series of triggering events may be required to initiate AD. Since somatic mutations accumulate with aging, and aging is a major risk factor for AD, there is a great potential for somatic mutational events to drive disease. Indeed, recent data from the Gozes team/laboratories as well as other leading laboratories correlated the accumulation of somatic brain mutations with the progression of tauopathy.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow stresses provide the energy needed to induce molecular conformation changes leading to AD by initiating amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau aggregation. Shear and extensional flow stresses initiate aggregation in the laboratory and in natural biophysical processes. Energy-rich CSF flow regions are mainly found in lower brain regions. MRI studies reveal flow stress \"hot spots\" in basal cisterns and brain ventricles that have chaotic flow properties that can distort molecules such as A\u03b2 and tau trapped in these regions into unusual conformations. Such fluid disturbance is surrounded by tissue deformation. There is strong mapping overlap between the locations of these hot spots and of early-stage AD pathology. Our mechanism creates pure and mixed protein dimers, followed by tissue surface adsorption, and long-term tissue agitation ultimately inducing chemical reactions forming more stable, toxic oligomer seeds that initiate AD. It is proposed that different flow stress energies and flow types in different basal brain regions produce different neurotoxic aggregates. Proliferating artery hardening is responsible for enhanced heart systolic pulses that drive energetic CSF pulses, whose critical maximum systolic pulse energy location migrates further from the heart with increasing vascular disease. Two glymphatic systems, carotid and basilar, are suggested to contain the earliest A\u03b2 and tau AD disease pathologies.

Digital health interventions (DHIs) hold promise in overcoming barriers to accessing mental health support for these individuals; however, the design and implementation of DHIs for depression and anxiety in people with chronic conditions are yet to be explored.This study aimed to explore what is known in the literature regarding DHIs for the prevention, detection, or treatment of depression and anxiety among people with chronic conditions.A scoping review of the literature was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Searches of the literature published in 5 databases between 1990 and 2019 were conducted in April 2019 and updated in March 2021. To be included, studies must have described a DHI tested with, or designed for, the prevention, detection, or treatment of depression or anxiety in people with common chronic conditions (arthritis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer disease or dementia). Studies were independently screened by 2 reviewers against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Both quantitative and qualitative data were extracted, charted, and synthesized to provide a descriptive summary of the trends and considerations for future research.Database searches yielded 11,422 articles across the initial and updated searches, 53 (0.46%) of which were included in this review. DHIs predominantly sought to provide treatment (44/53, 83%), followed by detection (5/53, 9%) and prevention (4/53, 8%). Most DHIs were focused on depression (36/53, 68%), guided (32/53, 60%), tailored to chronic physical conditions (19/53, 36%), and delivered through web-based platforms (20/53, 38%). Only 2 studies described the implementation of a DHI.As a growing research area, DHIs offer the potential to address the gap in care for depression and anxiety among people with chronic conditions; however, their implementation in standard care is scarce. Although stepped care has been identified as a promising model to implement efficacious DHIs, few studies have investigated the use of DHIs for depression and anxiety among chronic conditions using such models.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: 30\u00a0eligible articles were included. There was no strong evidence that accelerated epigenetic aging was associated with dementia/mild cognitive impairment (n\u00a0=\u00a07).

Impeding the formation of A\u03b2 \u03b2-structure-rich aggregates and dissociating A\u03b2 fibrils are considered potent strategies to suppress the onset and progression of AD. As a molecular chaperone, human \u03b1B-crystallin has received extensive attention in the inhibition of protein aggregation. Previous experiments reported that the structured core region of \u03b1B-crystallin (\u03b1BC) exhibits a better preventive effect on A\u03b2 aggregation and toxicity than the full-length protein. However, the molecular mechanism behind the effect of inhibition remains mostly unknown.

Our simulations show that \u03b1BC greatly impedes the formation of \u03b2-structure contents.

However, the underlying sources of regional vulnerability to tau pathology remain unclear. Previous brain-autopsy findings suggest that the myelin levels-which differ substantially between white matter tracts in the brain-are a key modulating factor of region-specific susceptibility to tau deposition. Here, we investigated whether myelination differences between fiber tracts of the human connectome are predictive of the interregional spreading of tau pathology in AD.We included two independently recruited samples consisting of amyloid-PET-positive asymptomatic and symptomatic elderly individuals, in whom tau-PET was obtained at baseline (ADNI: n\u2009=\u2009275; BioFINDER-1: n\u2009=\u2009102) and longitudinally in a subset (ADNI: n\u2009=\u2009123, mean FU\u2009=\u20091.53 [0.69-3.95] years; BioFINDER-1: n\u2009=\u200939, mean FU\u2009=\u20091.87 [1.21-2.78] years).

In\u00a0a spatial regression analysis, we first tested the association between cortical myelin and group-average tau-PET signal in the amyloid-positive and control groups. Secondly, employing a previously established approach of modeling tau-PET spreading based on functional connectivity between ROIs, we estimated in\u00a0a linear regression analysis, whether the level of fiber-tract myelin modulates the association between functional connectivity and longitudinal tau-PET spreading (i.e., covariance) between ROIs.We found that higher myelinated cortical regions show lower tau-PET uptake (ADNI: rho\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.267, p\u2009<\u20090.001; BioFINDER-1: rho\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.175, p\u2009=\u20090.013).

So far, molecular characterization of PAM was performed indirectly using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches or based on markers that are supposedly up-regulated in this microglia subpopulation.In this study based on a well-characterized AD mouse model, we combined cell-specific laser capture\u00a0microdissection and RNA-seq analysis to i) identify, without preconceived notions of the molecular and/or functional changes that would affect these cells, the genes and gene networks that are dysregulated in PAM or PCM at three critical stages of the disease, and ii) to investigate the potential contribution of both plaque-associated and plaque-distant microglia.First, we established that our approach allows selective isolation of microglia, while preserving spatial information and preventing transcriptome changes induced by classical purification approaches.

In this study, we assessed plant ceramide species with D-erythro-(4E,8Z)-sphingadienine and D-erythro-(8Z)-phytosphingenine as sphingoid bases that differ from mammalian-type species. Some plant ceramides were more effective than mammalian ceramides at stimulating exosome release. In addition, using deuterium chemistry-based lipidomics, most exogenous plant ceramides were confirmed to be derived from exosomes. These results suggest that the ceramide-dependent upregulation of exosome release may promote the release of exogenous ceramides from cells, and plant ceramides with long-chain fatty acids can effectively release neuronal exosomes and prevent AD pathology.", "Query": "Alzheimers", "Mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Ceramides", "Deuterium", "Exosomes", "Fatty Acids", "Mammals", "Mice"]}, "36142659": {"ArticleTitle": "Regulation of the Soluble Amyloid Precursor Protein \u03b1 (sAPP\u03b1) Levels by Acetylcholinesterase and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Lung Cancer Cell Media.", "ArticleAbstract": "In comparing two human lung cancer cells, we previously found lower levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and intact amyloid-\u03b240/42 (A\u03b2), and higher levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) in the media of H1299 cells as compared to A549 cell media.

Here, we demonstrate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD diagnosis approach using the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) fingerprints of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). SERS and CNN were combined for biomarker detection to analyze disease-associated biochemical changes in the CSF. We achieved very high reproducibility in double-blind experiments for testing the feasibility of our system on human samples. We achieved an overall accuracy of 92% (100% for normal individuals and 88.9% for AD individuals) based on the clinical diagnosis. Further, we observed an excellent correlation coefficient between our test score and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score. Our findings offer a substantial indication of the feasibility of detecting AD biomarkers using the innovative combination of SERS and machine learning.

Thus far, the roles of PGC-1a in Alzheimer's disease and its potential value for restoring mitochondrial dysfunction remain largely unknown. In the present study, we explored the impacts of PGC-1a on AD pathology and neurobehavioral dysfunction and its potential mechanisms with a particular focus on mitochondrial dynamics. Paralleling AD-related pathological deposits, neuronal apoptosis, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and lowered membrane potential, a remarkable reduction in the expression of PGC-1a was shown in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice at 6 months of age. By infusing AAV-Ppargc1\u03b1 into the lateral parietal association (LPtA) cortex of the APP/PS1 brain, we found that PGC-1a ameliorated AD-like behavioral abnormalities, such as deficits in spatial reference memory, working memory and sensorimotor gating. Notably, overexpressed PGC-1a in LPtA rescued mitochondrial swelling and damage in neurons, likely through correcting the altered balance in mitochondrial fission-fusion and its abnormal distribution.

Cortical and hippocampal hyperexcitability intervenes in the pathological derangement of brain activity leading to cognitive decline. As key regulators of neuronal excitability, the voltage-gated K+ channels (KV) might play a crucial role in the AD pathophysiology. Among them, the KV2.1 channel, the main \u03b1 subunit mediating the delayed rectifier K+ currents (IDR) and controlling the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, has been poorly examined in AD. In the present study, we investigated the KV2.1 protein expression and activity in hippocampal neurons from the Tg2576 mouse, a widely used transgenic model of AD. To this aim we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. Our Western blotting results reveal that KV2.1 was overexpressed in the hippocampus of 3-month-old Tg2576 mice and in primary hippocampal neurons from Tg2576 mouse embryos compared with the WT counterparts. Electrophysiological experiments unveiled that the whole IDR were reduced in the Tg2576 primary neurons compared with the WT neurons, and that this reduction was due to the loss of the KV2.1 current component. Moreover, we found that the reduction of the KV2.1-mediated currents was due to increased channel clustering, and that glutamate, a stimulus inducing KV2.1 declustering, was able to restore the IDR to levels comparable to those of the WT neurons.

Though efforts continue towards broadening and deepening our knowledge and understanding of the mechanistic and neuropathological underpinnings of AD, our previous failures motivate a re-examination of how we conceptualize AD pathology and progression. In addition to not yielding effective treatments, the phenotypically heterogeneous biological processes that have been the primary area of focus to date have not been adequately shown to be necessary or sufficient to explain the risk and progression of AD. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence indicates that lifestyle and environment represent the ultimate level of causation for AD and age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, the decline in cognitive demands over the lifespan plays a central role in driving the structural and functional deteriorations of the brain. In the absence of adequate cognitive stimulus, physiological demand-function coupling leads to downregulation of growth, repair, and homeostatic processes, resulting in deteriorating brain tissue health, function, and capacity. In this setting, the heterogeneity of associated neuropathological tissue hallmarks then occurs as a consequence of an individual's genetic and environmental background and are best considered downstream markers of the disease process rather than specific targets for direct intervention.

Remaining questions relate to whether adequate treatment of hypertension may prevent deterioration of cognitive function, the threshold for blood pressure treatment, and the most effective antihypertensive drugs. Recent advances in neurovascular biology, advanced brain imaging, and detection of subtle behavioral phenotypes have begun to provide insights into these critical issues. Importantly, a parallel analysis of these parameters in animal models and humans is feasible, making it possible to foster translational advancements.

To date, there is little evidence on whether gait is altered in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We aimed to identify impairments in gait performance and associations between gait impairment and neuroimaging markers of CAA, cognition, and falls. Methods and Results Gait was assessed using the Zeno Walkway during preferred pace and dual task walks, and grouped into gait domains (Rhythm, Pace, Postural Control, and Variability). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Falls and fear of falling were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Gait domain scores were standardized and analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, height, and other covariates. Participants were patients with CAA (n=29), Alzheimer disease with mild dementia (n=16), mild cognitive impairment (n=24), and normal elderly controls (n=47). CAA and Alzheimer disease had similarly impaired Rhythm, Pace, and Variability, and higher dual task cost than normal controls or mild cognitive impairment. Higher Pace score was associated with better global cognition, processing speed, and memory. Gait measures were not correlated with microbleed count or white matter hyperintensity volume. Number of falls was not associated with gait domain scores, but participants with low fear of falling had higher Pace (odds ratio [OR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.59-4.29]) and lower Variability (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.44]).

At the baseline (2014) and follow-up (2018) examinations, sleep parameters were assessed using standard questionnaires. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Meanwhile, A\u03b2 exhibits activity against herpes simplex virus type\u00a01 (HSV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV) replication, but not against other neurotropic viruses. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the most important neurotropic enterovirus in the post-polio era. Given the limitation of existing research on the relationship between A\u03b2 and other virus infections, this study aimed to investigate the potent activity of A\u03b2 on EV-A71 infection and extended the potential function of A\u03b2 in other unenveloped viruses may be linked to Alzheimer's disease or infectious neurological diseases.A\u03b2 peptides 1-42 are a major pathological factor of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, we utilized A\u03b21-42 as a test subject to perform our study. The production of monomer A\u03b21-42 and their high-molecular oligomer accumulations in neural cells were detected by immunofluorescence assay, ELISA, or Western blot assay.

Conversely, PTP1B inhibition has been shown to prevent microglial activation, thus exerting a potent anti-inflammatory effect and has also shown potential to increase the cognitive process through the stimulation of hippocampal insulin, leptin and BDNF/TrkB receptors. Notwithstanding, most research on the clinical efficacy of targeting PTP1B has been developed in the field of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (TD2M).

DST included Forward Digit Span Test (FDST) and Backward Digit Span Test (BDST). All the subjects underwent 3.0T coronal three-dimensional gradient echo sequence MRI. MTA scale was performed to evaluate the degree of medial temporal lobe atrophy.

Aerobic exercise (AE) enhances learning and memory, improves cognitive impairment, increases telomere binding protein expression, and decreases apoptosis regulators, but it remains unclear whether it can improve cognitive impairment caused by neuronal apoptosis in AD. Therefore, this study investigated whether an 8-week running table exercise intervention could reduce apoptosis and improve cognitive function in the hippocampal neurons of AD model mice. After the exercise intervention, we evaluated the learning memory ability (positioning, navigation, and spatial search) of mice using a Morris water labyrinth, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and protein application to detect hippocampal PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling pathway protein and hippocampal neuronal cell apoptosis protein B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and apoptosis-promoting protein bcl-2-related X (Bax) protein expression. The results showed that aerobic exercise improved the location and spatial exploration ability of mice, increased the number of PI3K- and p-Akt-positive cells, increased the expression of PI3K, p-Akt, and bcl-2 proteins, decreased the expression of GSK-3\u03b2 and Bax proteins, and increased the bcl-2/Bax ratio of mice.

Demographic and clinical characteristics, neuropsychological assessments, and APOE genotypes were recorded. Description, correlation and logistic regression models were used to analyze the presence of geriatric symptom complaints and their associations with APOE \u03b54.DLB patients displayed more frequency of fluctuating cognition, visual hallucination, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, delusion, depression, anxiety, apathy, and loss of appetite, whereas the PDD cases had constipation, fear of falling, and insomnia more frequently. The APOE \u03b54 allele was more common in DLB than PDD (29.9% vs. 7.0%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and the patients with DLB\u2009+\u2009APOE \u03b54 (+) were presented more delusions (p\u2009=\u20090.005) and apathy (p\u2009=\u20090.007) than patients with PDD\u2009+\u2009APOE \u03b54 (+).

Many studies have examined imaging characteristics in clinically diagnosed patients; however, there is a relative lack of longitudinal studies that have studied patients with pathological confirmation. We examined whether there were differences in longitudinal patterns of cortical atrophy between patients with both AD and DLB (AD/DLB) vs. those with AD alone.We collected and analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for patients who underwent autopsy. The rates of change in various neuropsychological assessments were not significantly different between AD/DLB and AD patients, and each group had neuropsychological outcomes consistent with disease progression. For our neuroimaging analysis, we used a linear mixed effects model to examine if there were longitudinal differences in cortical rates of atrophy between AD/DLB and AD patients.Autopsies and serial neuroimaging was available on 48 patients (24 AD, 24 AD/DLB). Patients with AD alone had significantly higher atrophy rates in the left cuneus, lateral occipital, and parahippocampal regions over time when compared to patients with concomitant DLB, after covarying for interval from imaging to autopsy, gender, and total estimated intracranial volume (eTIV). Site ID was included as a random effect to account for site differences. For these regions, the rate of decline over time in the AD/DLB group were less steep by a difference of 0.1887, 0.395, and 0.0989, respectively (p =.022, .006, and .006). The lattermost left cuneus volume measurement also positively correlated to Braak Lewy score (Pearson's product-moment correlation 0.37, p=.009), while the lattermost left parahippocampal volume measurement negatively correlated to Braak NFT score (Pearson's product-moment correlation -0.327, p=.02).AD patients had more significant atrophy in the left cuneus, lateral occipital, and parahippocampal regions when compared to AD/DLB patients.

Alterations to this system may play a pivotal role in amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation. However, its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the changes in noninvasive MRI measurements related to the perivascular network in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Additionally, we explored the associations of MRI measures with neuropsychological score, PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and A\u03b2 deposition.MRI measures, including perivascular space (PVS) volume fraction (PVSVF), fractional volume of free water in white matter (FW-WM), and index of diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS index) of patients with MCI, those with AD, and healthy controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were compared. MRI measures were also correlated with the levels of CSF biomarkers, PET SUVR, and cognitive score in the combined subcohort of patients with MCI and AD. Statistical analyses were performed with age, sex, years of education, and APOE status as confounding factors.In total, 36 patients with AD, 44 patients with MCI, and 31 healthy controls were analyzed. Patients with AD had significantly higher total, WM, and basal ganglia PVSVF (Cohen's d = 1.15-1.48; p < 0.001), and FW-WM (Cohen's d = 0.73; p < 0.05) and a lower ALPS index (Cohen's d = 0.63; p < 0.05) than healthy controls. Meanwhile, the MCI group only showed significantly higher total (Cohen's d = 0.99; p < 0.05) and WM (Cohen's d = 0.91; p < 0.05) PVSVF. Low ALPS index was associated with lower CSF A\u03b242 (r  = 0.41, p  = 0.026), FDG-PET uptake (r  = 0.54, p  < 0.001), and worse multiple cognitive domain deficits. High FW-WM was also associated with lower CSF A\u03b242 (r  = -0.47, p  = 0.021) and worse cognitive performances.Our study indicates that changes in PVS-related MRI parameters occur in MCI and AD, possibly due to impairment of the glymphatic system.

Recently, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was reported as an important enzyme, whose activity can provide predictive value for timely discovery and diagnosis of AD. Therefore, it is indispensable to design a detection tool for selective and rapid response toward BChE. In this study, we developed a novel near-infrared fluorescent probe () for the detection of BChE activity. An excellent sensitivity, good biocompatibility, and lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.12 ng/mL made the probe extremely specific for BChE, which was successfully used in biological imaging.

In all mouse and human synaptosomal preparations, tau release was inhibited by the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonist LY379268, an effect prevented by the selective mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495.

The performance of the downstream task generally improves when these latent representations are explicitly associated with factors of interest. For example, we derived such a representation for capturing brain aging by applying self-supervised learning to longitudinal MRIs and then used the resulting encoding to automatically identify diseases accelerating the aging of the brain. We now propose a refinement of this representation by replacing the linear modeling of brain aging with one that is consistent in local neighborhoods in the latent space. Called Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE), we derive an encoding so that neighborhoods are age-consistent (i.e., brain MRIs of different subjects with similar brain ages are in close proximity of each other) and progression-consistent, i.e., the latent space is defined by a smooth trajectory field where each trajectory captures changes in brain ages between a pair of MRIs extracted from a longitudinal sequence. To make the problem computationally tractable, we further propose a strategy for mini-batch sampling so that the resulting local neighborhoods accurately approximate the ones that would be defined based on the whole cohort. We evaluate LNE on three different downstream tasks: (1) to predict chronological age from T1-w MRI of 274 healthy subjects participating in a study at SRI International; (2) to distinguish Normal Control (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (sMCI) from progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (pMCI) based on T1-w MRI of 632 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); and (3) to distinguish no-to-low from moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinkers based on fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor MRIs of 764 adolescents recruited by the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Across the three data sets, the visualization of the smooth trajectory vector fields and superior accuracy on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information related to brain aging, which could help study the impact of substance use and neurodegenerative disorders.

However, the linearity of the fixed-effect structure in these models largely restrict their use to estimating treatment effects that are defined as linear combinations of effects on the outcome scale. In some situations, alternative quantifications of treatment effects may be more appropriate. In progressive diseases, for example, one may want to estimate if a drug has cumulative effects resulting in increasing efficacy over time or whether it slows the time progression of disease. This article introduces a class of nonlinear mixed-effects models called progression models for repeated measures (PMRMs) that, based on a continuous-time extension of the categorical-time parametrization of MMRMs, enables estimation of novel types of treatment effects, including measures of slowing or delay of the time progression of disease. Compared to conventional estimates of treatment effects where the unit matches that of the outcome scale (eg, 2 points benefit on a cognitive scale), the time-based treatment effects can offer better interpretability and clinical meaningfulness (eg, 6\u00a0months delay in progression of cognitive decline). The PMRM class includes conventionally used MMRMs and related models for longitudinal data analysis, as well as variants of previously proposed disease progression models as special cases. The potential of the PMRM framework is illustrated using both simulated and historical data from clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease with different types of artificially simulated treatment effects.

Inhibition of tau seeding activity could provide a potential therapeutic opportunity to block the propagation of tau pathology in AD and related tauopathies.In the present study, we investigated the role of 77G7, a monoclonal tau antibody to the microtubule-binding repeats, in repressing the seeding activity of proteopathic tau.We found that 77G7 had a higher affinity toward aggregated pathological tau fractions than un-aggregated tau derived from AD brain. 77G7 inhibited the internalization of tau aggregates by cells, blocked AD O-tau to capture normal tau, and to seed tau aggregation in vitro and in cultured cells.

The sporadic AD rat model was established by intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection with streptozotocin (STZ). PA (25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg) was given to rat orally once daily for 42 consecutive days. Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to determine the learning and memory functions of the STZ-induced AD rats.

MWM test results showed that PA could significantly ameliorate the learning and memory deficits induced by STZ in rats. Meanwhile, PA enhanced the expression of SIRT1, and markedly alleviated the tau pathology by inhibiting the hyperacetylation (at the site of Lys174) and hyperphosphorylation (at the sites of Thr181, Thr205, Ser396 and Ser404) of tau protein. PA also efficiently suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) expression and the deacetylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) at Lys 310 (K310) in the STZ-treated AD rats. EX527, a SIRT1 selective inhibitor, could partially abolish the cognitive deficits improving effect of PA and inhibit the down-regulation of acetylated tau and acetylated NF-\u03baB p65, suggesting that PA exhibited neuroprotective effects against AD via upregulating SIRT1.This study reported for the first time that PA could penetrate the BBB to exert its protective effects on the brain after a single-dose oral administration. The current experimental findings also amply demonstrated that PA could improve the cognitive and memory impairments in the STZ-induced AD rat model.

These disorders are characterized by the gradual loss of a selectively vulnerable group of neurons. Due to the complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind neurodegeneration and despite enormous efforts and understanding of the occurrence and progression of NDs, there is still a lack of an effective treatment for such diseases. Therefore, the development of a new therapeutic strategy for NDs is an unmet clinical need. Various natural compounds extracted from medicinal plants or fruits have shown promising activities in treating different types of NDs by targeting multiple signaling pathways. Among natural entities, flavonoids have incited a rise in public and scientific interest in recent years because of their purported health-promoting effects. Dietary supplementation of flavonoids has been shown to mitigate the severity of NDs such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and dementia by their antioxidant effects. Naringenin is a citrus flavonoid that is known to possess numerous biological activities like antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, naringenin has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent that exerts preventive and curative effects on several neurological disorders. Increasing evidence has attained special attention on the variety of therapeutic targets along with complex signaling pathways of naringenin, which suggest its possible therapeutic applications in several NDs. Derived from the results of several pre-clinical research and considering the therapeutic effects of this compound, this review focuses on the potential role of naringenin as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The overall neuroprotective effects and different possible underlying mechanisms related to naringenin are discussed. In the light of substantial evidence for naringenin's neuroprotective efficacy in several experimental paradigms, this review suggests that this molecule should be investigated further as a viable candidate for the management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with an emphasis on mechanistic and clinical trials to determine its efficacy.

Naringenin has been shown to exhibit remarkable therapeutic efficacy and has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of a variety of diseases such as various heart, liver, and metabolic disorders. Similarly, it has shown efficacy in neurodegenerative illnesses. Therefore, this review enables us to better understand the neuroprotective effects and different possible underlying mechanisms of naringenin.

Methods: Data of clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with HL diagnosed in Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CHCAMS) from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2018 who received standard first-line treatment were retrospectively analyzed and compared with that of HL patients who received treatment in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database in the United States during the same period. Factors associated with freedom from progression (FFP) of patients in CHCAMS were analyzed. Treatment and survival data of patients with relapsed/refractory HL (r/rHL) who had failed the standard first-line treatment during the corresponding period in CHCAMS were collected to analyze the outcomes of salvage therapy. Results: A total of 764 HL patients in CHCAMS were included in this study. The median age was 30 years (range, 14-83 years), with 424 males and 340 females. By February 26th, 2022, the patients were followed-up for a median time of 111 months(range, 0.3-262.0 months). Lymphoma-specific survival (LSS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate at 10 years for HL patients in CHCAMS was 91.7% (95%CI: 89.5%-93.9%) and 87.1% (95%CI: 84.5%-89.8%), respectively. LSS and OS rate at 10 years for HL patients from SEER database was 86.8% (95%CI: 86.3%-87.2%) and 79.0% (95%CI: 78.5%-79.5%), respectively. The unadjusted LSS and OS rate for patients in CHCAMS were higher than those for patients from SEER database (both P<0.001). No significant difference was observed in LSS and OS rate (both P>0.05) between the two groups after adjustment. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer staging system (early-stage unfavorable: HR=2.35, 95%CI: 1.13-4.89, P=0.023; advanced stage: HR=5.44, 95%CI: 2.62-11.30, P<0.001) and serum \u03b22 microglobulin (HR=1.67, 95%CI: 1.08-2.58, P=0.021) were influencing factors of FFP for patients in CHCAMS. The complete remission rate, median progression-free survival (PFS), 5-year PFS rate and 5-year OS rate for the 116 patients with r/rHL was 37.9% (95%CI: 29.6%-47.0%), 15.0 months (95%CI: 9.9-20.1 months), 29.9% (95%CI: 20.9%-38.9%) and 62.9% (95%CI: 54.1%-71.7%), respectively.

Methods: Clinical data of 145 children (aged \u226418 years) with newly diagnosed HL, treated with HL-2013 regimen in 8 tertiary referral centers for childhood cancer from August 2011 to April 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. All the diagnosis were confirmed by histopathological morphology and immunohistochemical examination. The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were summarized, and the patients were divided into different groups according to clinical characteristics. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and the comparison of survival rates between groups was performed with Log-rank test. Results: Of the 145 cases, there were 115 males and 30 females, the age at diagnosis was 7.9 (5.8, 10.6) years. Cervical lymph node enlargement (114 cases, 78.6%) was the common symptom of the disease, and 57 patients (39.3%) were accompanied by large masses. The most common pathological classification was mixed cell type (93 cases, 64.1%). According to the Ann Arbor staging system, there were 9 cases of stage \u2160, 62 cases of stage \u2161, 45 cases of stage \u2162, 29 cases of stage \u2163. According to the risk stratification: there were 14 cases of low-risk group, 76 cases of medium-risk group and 55 cases of high-risk group. Of all patients, 68 cases (46.9%) achieved an early complete remission (CR) after 2 courses of chemotherapy, and the CR rate was 93.8% (136/145) after first-line treatment. Disease recurrence or progression occurred in 22 cases (15.2%). Of all patients, 125 cases survived, 6 cases died and 14 cases were lost to follow-up. Among the survived cases, 123 cases were continuously at CR state,and the follow-up time was 55 (40, 76) months. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) rates were (95.3\u00b11.9)% and (84.2\u00b13.0)% for the entire group, respectively. 5-year OS and EFS rates for patients with stage \u2162-\u2163 were both lower than those for patients with stage \u2160-\u2161 (\u03c72=6.28 and 7.58, both P<0.05), the 5-year OS and EFS rates for patients in high-risk group were both lower than those for patients in low-risk and medium-risk group (\u03c72=10.93, 7.79, both P<0.05). The 5-year OS rates for the patient with early CR and without early CR were 100.0% and (90.9\u00b13.6)% (\u03c72=5.77, P=0.016). EFS rates for the patient with early CR (68 cases) and without early CR (77 cases) were (93.8\u00b13.0)% and (75.8\u00b15.0)% (\u03c72=8.78, P=0.003). Conclusions: HL-2013 regimen is significantly effective in the treatment of pediatric HL.

investigate the efficacy of anterolateral thigh flap preforming tongue in patients with total glossectomy. Methods: A total of 27 patients with tongue cancer who underwent total glossectomy, neck lymph node dissection and anterolateral thigh flap transfer were collected from January 2019 to April 2021 in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Second Xiangya Hospital. All patients were males, the age ranged from 35-73 years. The patients were divided into experimental (14 cases) and control (13 cases) groups, based on whether the tongue was reconstructed. The clinical parameters of two groups were analyzed by independent sample t test or Fisher exact probability method. Results: The success rate of free flap was 100%, of the patients, 2 patients had cervical hematoma and 1 patient had wound infection postoperatively. There was no difference in speech (6.69\u00b13.42 vs. 5.50\u00b13.01, t=0.96, P=0.346) or swallowing (\u03c72=0.46, P=0.793) function between two groups at 1 month after surgery. However, the speech (24.94\u00b17.43 vs. 18.44\u00b16.30, t=2.48, P=0.020) and swallowing (\u03c72=6.97, P=0.008) functions in experimental group were significantly better than those in control group. No case was lost to follow-up. All patients were extubated after operation, with average time of 7.2 days in the experimental group and 7.7 days in the control group. The overall survival rate was 71.4% in the experimental group and 61.5% in the control group. Conclusion: The use of anterolateral thigh flap preforming tongue can improve the speech and swallowing functions in patients with total glossectomy and offer a novel method for tongue construction.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u80a1\u524d\u5916\u4fa7\u6e38\u79bb\u76ae\u74e3\u9884\u6210\u5f62\u820c\u4f53\u5728\u5168\u820c\u5207\u9664\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u6536\u96c62019\u5e741\u6708\u81f32021\u5e744\u6708\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u6e58\u96c5\u4e8c\u533b\u9662\u884c\u5168\u820c\u5207\u9664\u672f\u53ca\u6dcb\u5df4\u6e05\u626b\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u80a1\u524d\u5916\u4fa7\u6e38\u79bb\u76ae\u74e3\u4fee\u590d\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b27\u4f8b\uff0c\u5747\u4e3a\u7537\u6027\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5e74\u9f8435~73\u5c81\u3002\u4f9d\u636e\u672f\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u91c7\u7528\u76ae\u74e3\u9884\u6210\u5f62\u820c\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ec4\u4e3a\u672f\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u76ae\u74e3\u9884\u6210\u5f62\u820c\u4f53\uff0814\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u4e3a\u672f\u4e2d\u672a\u9884\u6210\u5f62\u820c\u4f53\uff0813\u4f8b\uff09\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ec4\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u8ba1\u91cf\u8d44\u6599\u3001\u8ba1\u6570\u8d44\u6599\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u6837\u672ct\u68c0\u9a8c\u548cFisher\u786e\u5207\u6982\u7387\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a 2\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u540e\u9888\u90e8\u8840\u80bf\uff0c1\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u540e\u9888\u90e8\u4f24\u53e3\u611f\u67d3\uff0c\u5bf9\u75c7\u5904\u7406\u540e\u5747\u6cbb\u6108\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u60a3\u8005\u76ae\u74e3\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a100%\u3002\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ec4\u548c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u672f\u540e1\u4e2a\u6708\u8bed\u97f3\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff3b\uff086.69\u00b13.42\uff09\u5206\u6bd4\uff085.50\u00b13.01\uff09\u5206\uff0ct=0.96\uff0cP=0.346\uff3d\u53ca\u541e\u54bd\u529f\u80fd\uff08\u03c72=0.46\uff0cP=0.793\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u672f\u540e6\u4e2a\u6708\u65f6\uff0c\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ec4\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u8f83\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584\uff3b\uff0824.94\u00b17.43\uff09\u5206\u6bd4\uff0818.44\u00b16.30\uff09\u5206\uff0ct=2.48\uff0cP=0.020\uff3d\uff0c\u541e\u54bd\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u03c72=6.97\uff0cP=0.008\uff09\u3002\u968f\u8bbf6~24\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u65e0\u5931\u8bbf\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u540e\u5747\u62d4\u9664\u6c14\u7ba1\u5957\u7ba1\uff0c\u62d4\u7ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ec4\u5e73\u5747\u4e3a7.2 d\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u5e73\u5747\u4e3a7.7 d\u3002\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ec4\u603b\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u4e3a71.4%\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u603b\u751f\u5b58\u4e3a61.5%\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u80a1\u524d\u5916\u4fa7\u76ae\u74e3\u9884\u6210\u5f62\u820c\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u6062\u590d\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u540e\u7684\u541e\u54bd\u53ca\u8a00\u8bed\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u820c\u5207\u9664\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36319128": {"ArticleTitle": "[Application of lateral upper arm free flap in the repair of postoperative defects of oral cancer].", "ArticleAbstract": "Objective: To explore the clinical application and efficacy of lateral upper arm free flap (LUAFF) for one-stage repairing of soft tissue defect after oral cancer surgery. Methods: This article was a retrospective analysis of clinical data of 46 patients receiving treatment of one-stage repairing of soft tissue defect with LUAFF after oral cancer surgery in Hunan Cancer Hospital, from June 2019 to June 2021. Among these cases, 40 were males, and 6 were females. The patients' ages were from 23 to 64 years old. The clinical data of patients were reviewed and outcomes were evaluated. SPSS 23.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: In the LUAFF of 46 patients, flap area ranged from 5.0 cm\u00d73.5 cm to 15.0 cm\u00d77.0 cm; the mean pedicle length was 8.15\u00b11.42 cm; the mean artery diameter was 1.20\u00b10.41 mm (range, 1.5 to 2.5 mm); the mean diameter of the largest veins was 2.15\u00b10.52 mm; and the median number of perforators was 2.6 (range, 1 to 4). All donor sites were closed primarily. Two cases had arterial anastomosis thrombosis, but their flaps were successfully saved with urgent re-anastomosis of the vessels. The overall flap survival rate was 93.5%(43/46), with flap necroses after operation in three cases. No patient received tracheotomy.

The activity of FOXOs is mainly regulated by post-translational modification, and its inactivation is mainly mediated by the over-activation of its upstream modifying enzymes, which provides a possibility to use drugs to recover its activity. It is worth noting that FOXOs can not only inhibit, but also promote the occurrence and development of human tumors due to the complex effects of FOXOs. This review will summarize the structure and activity regulation of FOXOs, and discuss their tumor inhibiting effects by limiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, as well as their tumor promoting effects by maintaining cell homeostasis, promoting metastasis and inducing drug resistance, so as to provide new ideas for the pathological research of related diseases and open up new ways to promote broader prevention and treatment strategies.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36319079": {"ArticleTitle": "The avoiding late diagnosis of ovarian cancer (ALDO) project; a pilot national surveillance programme for women with pathogenic germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.", "ArticleAbstract": "Our study aimed to establish 'real-world' performance and cost-effectiveness of ovarian cancer (OC) surveillance in women with pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 variants who defer risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO).Our study recruited 875 female BRCA1/2-heterozygotes at 13 UK centres and via an online media campaign, with 767 undergoing at least one 4-monthly surveillance test with the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) test.

Approved by Food and Drug Administration, atezolizumab has become the first new drug to treat advanced bladder cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether PD-L1 is associated with the lymphocytes infiltration in the tumour microenvironment and to assess the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression.Among 96 invasive bladder urothelial carcinomas, some were used to construct tissue-microarrays, and some cases with shallow infiltration or large heterogeneity were performed, respectively, for the following work. By means of immunohistochemistry and HE, PD-L1 expression and immune cell infiltration in the invasive front of urothelial carcinoma were analysed.We find that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells and lymphocytes are significantly associated with more tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and more T cells. The integrated TILs, T-PD-L1 and I-PD-L1 are not significantly correlated with the overall survival (OS) of patients. However, the combination of T-PD-L1 and TILs, T-PD-L1 and I-PD-L1 is significantly correlated with the OS of patients. The T-PD-L1 (-)/TIL (-) group show the best prognosis and the T-PD-L1 (+)/I-PD-L1 (-) group show the worst prognosis.

Current treatments are hampered by variability in NK cell subset responses, a limitation which could be circumvented by specific expansion of highly potent single killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)+NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells to maximize missing-self reactivity.We developed a GMP-compliant protocol to expand adaptive NK cells from cryopreserved cells derived from select third-party superdonors, that is, donors harboring large adaptive NK cell subsets with desired KIR specificities at baseline. We studied the adaptive state of the cell product (ADAPT-NK) by flow cytometry and mass cytometry as well as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-Seq). We investigated the functional responses of ADAPT-NK cells against a wide range of tumor target cell lines and primary AML samples using flow cytometry and IncuCyte as well as in a mouse model of AML.ADAPT-NK cells were >90% pure with a homogeneous expression of a single self-HLA specific KIR and expanded a median of 470-fold. The ADAPT-NK cells largely retained their adaptive transcriptional signature with activation of effector programs without signs of exhaustion. ADAPT-NK cells showed high degranulation capacity and efficient killing of HLA-C/KIR mismatched tumor cell lines as well as primary leukemic blasts from AML patients. Finally, the expanded adaptive NK cells had preserved robust antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity potential and combination of ADAPT-NK cells with an anti-CD16/IL-15/anti-CD33 tri-specific engager led to near-complete killing of resistant CD45dim blast subtypes.These preclinical data demonstrate the feasibility of off-the-shelf therapy with a non-engineered, yet highly specific, NK cell population with full missing-self recognition capability.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36319064": {"ArticleTitle": "Deciphering molecular and cellular ex vivo responses to bispecific antibodies PD1-TIM3 and PD1-LAG3 in human tumors.", "ArticleAbstract": "Next-generation cancer immunotherapies are designed to broaden the therapeutic repertoire by targeting new immune checkpoints including lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3).

There is compelling evidence that TNFR2 plays a crucial role in the activation, expansion, and phenotypic stability of Tregs and promotes tumor immune evasion. Understanding of epigenetic regulation of TNFR2 expression in Tregs may help device a novel strategy in cancer immunotherapy.MiR-125b-5p-overexpressing or knockdown murine CD4 T cells and Tregs were constructed, and the effect of miR-125b-5p on Tregs proliferation, suppressive function and TNFR2 expression were examined. In vivo antitumor efficacy of Ago-125b-5p (miR-125b-5p agomir) was evaluated in MC38 tumor bearing mice, and tumor-infiltrating Tregs and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were analyzed. RNA-seq analysis was applied to reveal the genes and signaling pathways regulated by miR-125b-5p in Tregs.In this study, we found that TNFR2 was a direct target of miR-125b-5p. Overexpression of miR-125b-5p decreased the proportion of Tregs and their expression of TNFR2 and consequently inhibited its proliferation and suppressive function by regulating the metabolism-related signaling pathways. Moreover, in colon cancer bearing mice, the administration of Ago-125b-5p markedly inhibited the tumor growth, which was associated with reduction of Tregs and increase of IFN\u03b3+CD8+ T cells in tumor environment. Furthermore, in human colon adenocarcinoma patients, we verified that miR-125b-5p expression was downregulated, and low levels of miR-125b-5p were associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, the expression of miR-125b-5p and TNFR2 were negatively correlated.Our study for the first time found that the expression of TNFR2 by Tregs was regulated by miR-125b-5p. Our results showed that miR-125b-5p had the capacity to inhibit the expression of TNFR2 and immunosuppressive activity of Tregs and consequently enhanced the antitumor efficacy.

Although NQO1 is recognized as an oxidative stress response gene, it does not appear to have a direct role in ferroptosis inhibition in the absence of tanshinone.

Between 2009 and 2016, 400 patients with T1-T3N0M0 breast cancer were operated at the Odesa Regional Clinical Hospital. Two types of dyes - Patent Blue and ICG were used. The patients who had mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy as a rule had a clinical diagnosis of T2-T3N0M0 breast cancer. In group 1, 100 patients had sentinel lymph node biopsy. Staining of lymph nodes was performed using Patent Blue. In group 2, sentinel lymph nodes biopsy was conducted using Patent Blue and another fluorescent dye ICG, which was also administered subdermally. A total five-year survival rate after axillary lymph dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy was 91% and 92%, respectively. A five-year recurrence-free survival rate after axillary lymph dissection was approximately 82.2%, and after sentinel lymph node biopsy - 83.9%. Regional recurrence in the sentinel lymph nodes on the affected side were found in only 1.1% of cases. The sentinel lymph nodes were intact in 58% of patients, so, the next lymph dissection was not performed. The affected lymph nodes were observed in 42% of patients.

Fifty BUST participants and 50 \"controls\" who underwent DBT and US in regular order filled out the EQ-5D-3L three times during their visit: BUST participants before US (T1), after US (T2), and after DBT (T3) and non-BUST participants before DBT (T1), after DBT (T2), and after US (T3). Changes in QoL from baseline to T2 and T3 were assessed using generalized least squares, also taking into account the effects of biopsy, age, and complaint type.  Participants' mean age was 50.6 years (BUST: SD\u2009=\u200912.1, controls: SD\u2009=\u200911.5). At T2 the overall QoL was higher [t(102.9)\u2009=\u20092.4, p\u2009=\u20090.017] and anxiety levels were lower [t(98.7)\u2009=\u2009-2.4, p\u2009=\u20090.020] in BUST participants compared with controls.

Increasing the number of ACUPA ligands improved the in vitro binding affinity of PEG-derived polymers to PC3-Pip cells.

To demonstrate this concept, here we report one of the first attempts on enzyme-responsive polymers from aryl-unit containing amino acid bioresources such as l-tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA). A silyl ether protection strategy was adopted to make melt polymerizable monomers, which were subjected to solvent free melt polycondensation to produce silyl-protected poly(ester-urethane)s. Postpolymerization deprotection yielded phenol- and catechol-functionalized poly(ester-urethane)s with appropriate amphiphilicity and produced 100 \u00b1 10 nm size nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. The aromatic \u03c0-core in the nanoparticle turns out to be the main driving force for the successful encapsulation of anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX) and topotecan (TPT). The electron-rich catechol aromatic unit in l-DOPA was found to be unique in stabilizing the DOX and TPT, whereas its l-tyrosine counterpart was found to exhibit limited success. Aromatic \u03c0-interactions between l-DOPA and anticancer drug molecules were established by probing the fluorescence characteristics of the drug-polymer chain interactions. Lysosomal enzymatic biodegradation of the poly(ester-urethane) backbone disassembled the nanoparticles and released the loaded drugs at the cellular level. The nascent polymer was nontoxic in breast cancer (MCF7) and WT-MEF cell lines, whereas its DOX and TPT loaded nanoparticles showed remarkable cell growth inhibition.

In this work, we demonstrate a new strategy to selectively inhibit TrxR through constructing electrophilic center -N-Se(\u03b4+)-N- by using the polarization effect of the selenium atom. The constructed electrophilic center interacts noncovalently with the active motif of TrxR to avoid the interference of other residues in human tissues, thereby selectively inhibiting intracellular TrxR activity. Computational and experimental analysis confirms that the formed electrophilic selenium center preferred to attack the SeC residues in the redox active center of TrxR at the 498 site through strong noncovalent interactions.

Nevertheless, the simultaneous detection of multiple nucleic acids within one assay using the CRISPR-Cas system is still challenging. In this study, we develop an AND logic-gate-based CRISPR-Cas12a biosensing platform to achieve the sensitive colorimetric detection of dual miRNAs. Specifically, the DNA probe was designed to recognize the binary input of miRNAs and to output trigger DNA, which activated the CRISPR-Cas12a system to cut single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The ssDNA on magnetic beads (MBs) was cleaved by the activated CRISPR-Cas12a, causing the separation of glucose oxidase (GOx) from MB and the subsequent generation of a colorimetric signal. The color change induced by 1 pM of target miRNAs can be directly distinguished by the naked eye and the instrumental limit of detection reaches 36.4 fM. The overexpressed miR-205 and miR-944 in the real human serum can be detected, allowing us to differentiate between lung cancer patients and healthy people. Furthermore, the developed strategy achieves simultaneous detection of dual miRNAs using CRISPR-Cas12a with one kind of crRNA, avoiding sophisticated nucleic acid amplifications and the use of bulky instruments.

Here, we describe a mechanism of regulated degradation of the INM SUN domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2). We show that Casein Kinase II and the C-terminal domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1) have opposing effects on SUN2 levels by regulating SUN2 binding to the ubiquitin ligase Skp/Cullin1/F-Box\u03b2TrCP (SCF\u03b2TrCP). Upon binding to phosphorylated SUN2, SCF\u03b2TrCP promotes its ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated SUN2 is membrane extracted by the AAA ATPase p97 and delivered to the proteasome for degradation.

The molecular subtype affects therapy options because it is a complex disorder with multiple subtypes. By concentrating on receptor activation, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) can be employed as a therapeutic target. The goal of this work was to screen a number of inhibitors produced from Hibiscus rosa-sinensis for possible target to inhibit the mTOR and to determine which has the greatest affinity for the receptor. Primarily, the ionization states of the chosen compounds were predicted using the ChemAxon web platform, and their pKa values were estimated. Given the significance of interactions between proteins in the development of drugs, structure-based virtual screening was done using AutoDock Vina. Approximately 120 Hibiscus components and ten approved anti-cancer drugs, including the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, were used in the comparative analysis. By using Lipinski's rule of five to the chosen compounds, the ADMET profile and drug-likeness characteristics were further examined to assess the anti-breast cancer activity. The compounds with the highest ranked binding poses were loaded using the SeeSAR tool and the HYDE scoring to give interactive, desolvation, and visual \u0394G estimation for ligand binding affinity assessment. Following, the prospective candidates underwent three replicas of 100\u00a0ns long molecular dynamics simulations, preceded with MM-GBSA binding free energy calculation. The stability of the protein-ligand complex was determined using root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and protein-ligand interactions. The results demonstrated that the best mTOR binding affinities were found for stigmastadienol (107), lupeol (66), and taraxasterol acetate (111), which all performed well in comparison to the control compounds.

Checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as monotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) have a limited role due to low response rates, but are capable of long, durable responses. Combination PARP inhibition with checkpoint blockade is an emerging area of investigation with potential synergy to produce robust responses with durability. Mechanistically, PARP inhibition activates the stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway to promote dendritic cell and T lymphocyte recruitment, increases tumor neoantigens, and upregulates PD-L1 expression to increase the immunogenicity of the tumor and thereby potentially enhance responses to immunotherapy. Several clinical trials have reported early results on PARP inhibitor and PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor combinations. All studies have shown safety and tolerability of this combination regimen. In advanced breast cancer associated with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, response rates have been high and similar to what is observed with PARP inhibitor monotherapy. Additional follow-up is needed to see if combination with a checkpoint inhibitor can lead to a clinically meaningful extension of durability of response in patients with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.

FOXM1 mRNA and protein expression were substantially upregulated in tumor tissues, with the majority of these proteins localized in nucleo-cytoplasm. Elevated protein levels of FOXM1 were strongly correlated with lower education level, larger tumor size, lymph node status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), lymph node metastasis (LNM), tumor invasion depth (subserosal and serosal invasion), late stage (III and IV), localization (nucleo-cytoplasmic), intensity (strong) and recurrence.

Oncologists who had submitted at least 1 single-patient EA request to the institutional review boards at the University of Pennsylvania, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, NYU Langone Health, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from January 1, 2014, through January 31, 2020, were eligible to participate.

Oncologists viewed EA as an important tool for securing what they determined to be the best treatment option for their patients based on their own expert assessment of available data. Interviewees reported that they would rather access interventions as commercially available products or through clinical trials; however, if the preferred option was not available through these means, they viewed pursuit of EA as part of their obligation to patients, while often recognizing the potential for inequities in the broader patient population beyond their institutions. Participating oncologists felt confident pursuing investigational drugs for treatment use, despite the absence of FDA marketing approval, and did not necessarily view EA as a last resort.These findings indicate that oncologists practicing in large academic settings sought to treat patients with the interventions they deemed most likely to be beneficial, regardless of approval status. As such, they viewed EA as an unexceptional means to obtain promising products, although it remains unclear whether their confidence in evaluating investigational treatments was justified.

Herein, we demonstrate control over gold nanoparticle (GNP) penetration and spatial distribution across solid tumors by administering GNPs with different surface chemistries at a constant injection rate via syringe pump. A key finding in this study is the discovery of different zone-specific accumulation patterns of intratumorally injected nanoparticles dependent on surface functionalization. Computed tomography (CT) imaging performed in vivo of C57BL/6 mice harboring Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors on their flank and gross visualization of excised tumors consistently revealed that intratumorally administered citrate-GNPs accumulate in particle clusters in central areas of the tumor, while GNPs functionalized with thiolated phosphothioethanol (PTE-GNPs) and thiolated polyethylene glycol (PEG-GNPs) regularly accumulate in the tumor periphery. Further, PEG functionalization resulted in larger tumoral surface coverage than PTE, reaching beyond the outer zone of the tumor mass and into the surrounding stroma. To understand the dissimilarities in spatiotemporal evolution across the different GNP surface chemistries, we modeled their intratumoral transport with reaction-diffusion equations. Our results suggest that GNP surface passivation affects nanoparticle reactivity with the tumor microenvironment, leading to differential transport behavior across tumor zones. The present study provides a mechanistic understanding of the factors affecting spatiotemporal distribution of nanoparticles in the tumor.

Therefore, it is essential to distinguish benign from malignant adenomas in the early screening of colorectal cancer. Many deep learning computational pathology studies based on whole slide images (WSIs) have been proposed. Most approaches require manual annotation of lesion regions on WSIs, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study proposes a new approach MIST - Multiple Instance learning network based on Swin Transformer, which can accurately classify colorectal adenoma WSIs only with slide-level labels. MIST uses Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract features of images through self-supervised contrastive learning and uses a dual-stream multiple instance learning network to predict the class of slides. We trained and validated MIST on 666 WSIs collected from 480 colorectal adenoma patients in the Department of Pathology, the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School. These slides contained six common types of colorectal adenomas. The accuracy of external validation on 273 newly-collected WSIs from Nanjing First Hospital was 0.784, which was superior to the existing methods and reached a level comparable to that of the local pathologist's accuracy of 0.806. Finally, we analyzed the interpretability of MIST and observed that the lesion areas of interest in MIST were generally consistent with local pathologists. In conclusion, MIST is a low-burden, interpretable and effective approach that can be used in colorectal cancer screening and potential reduction of the mortality of CRC patients by assisting clinicians in the decision-making process.

Increased T-cell responses and cross-recognition of B.1.1.529 Omicron variant-specific mutations were observed ex vivo in mRNA- and heterologous-vaccinated donors compared to vector-vaccinated donors. Nevertheless, potent expandability of T cells targeting the spike protein was observed for all vaccination regimens with frequency, diversity and the ability to produce several cytokines of vaccine-induced T-cell responses comparable to those in convalescent donors. T-cell responses for all vaccinated donors significantly exceeded preexisting cross-reactive T-cell responses in prepandemic donors. Booster vaccination led to a significant increase of anti-spike IgG responses, which showed a marked decline 6 month after complete vaccination.

We first extracted CT and dose information from intratumoral nasopharynx (GTV_nx) and lymph node (GTV_nd) regions. Then the corresponding peritumoral regions (RING_3mm and RING_5mm) were also considered. Thus, the individual and combination of intra- and peri-tumoral regions were as follows: GTV_nx, GTV_nd, RING_3mm_nx, RING_3mm_nd, RING_5mm_nx, RING_5mm_nd, GTV_nxnd, RING_3mm_nxnd, RING_5mm_nxnd, GTV+RING_3mm_nxnd and GTV+RING_5mm_nxnd.

Current literature indicates an association between high CDR3-cancer antigen complementarity and improved survival outcomes. For example, high CDR3-BRAF electrostatic complementarity is associated with a better melanoma outcome. However, such CDR3-cancer antigen chemical complementarity in ovarian cancer was largely associated with worse outcomes. Specifically, high CDR3-MAGEB4 and CDR3-TDRD1 electrostatic complementarity was associated with lower ovarian cancer disease free survival (DFS). Additionally, high CDR3-MAGEB4 and CDR3-TDRD1 electrostatic complementarity was associated with decreased MAGEB4/TDRD1 gene expression and gene copy numbers, consistent with a selection against ovarian cancer cells expressing these antigens. However, when TDRD1 was split into fragments, high CDR3-TDRD1 hydrophobicity complementarity, for a specific TDRD1 fragment, was associated with increased DFS and higher immune marker expression levels.

These functions are regulated by local neuroendocrine and immune systems with a plethora of signaling molecules produced by resident and immune cells. In addition, neurotransmitters, endocrine factors, neuropeptides, and cytokines released from nerve endings play a central role in the skin responses to stress. These molecules act on the corresponding receptors in an intra-, juxta-, para- or autocrine fashion. The epidermis as the outer most component of skin forms a barrier directly protecting against environmental stressors. This protection is assured by an intrinsic keratinocyte differentiation program, pigmentary system and local nervous, immune, endocrine, and microbiome elements. These constituents communicate cross-functionally among themselves and with corresponding systems in the dermis and hypodermis to secure the basic epidermal functions to maintain local (skin) and global (systemic) homeostasis. The neurohormonal mediators and cytokines used in these communications regulate physiological skin functions separately or in concert. Disturbances in the functions in these systems lead to cutaneous pathology that includes inflammatory (psoriasis, allergic or atopic dermatitis) and keratinocytic hyperproliferative disorders (seborrheic and solar keratoses), dysfunction of adnexal structure (hair follicles, eccrine and sebaceous glands), hypersensitivity reactions, pigmentary disorders (vitiligo, melasma and hypo- or hyperpigmentary responses, premature aging, and malignancies (melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers).

In this article, we set out twelve challenges identified from a rapid review of the literature and suggest solutions to the challenges identified. Two challenges were common to all economic evaluations: choice of perspective and time-horizon. Five challenges were relevant for all diagnostic technologies: complexity of analysis; range of costs; under-developed evidence base; behavioral aspects; and choice of outcome metrics. The final five challenges were pertinent for genomic tests and only these may require methodological development: heterogeneity of tests and platforms, increasing stratification, capturing personal utility; incidental findings; and spillover effects. Current methods of economic evaluation are generally able to cope with genomic/genetic tests, although a renewed focus on specific decision-makers' needs and a willingness to move away from cost-utility analysis may be required. Certain analysts may be constrained by reference cases developed primarily for the assessment of pharmaceuticals. The combined impact of multiple challenges may require analysts to be particularly careful in setting the scope of their analysis in order to ensure that feasibility is balanced with usefulness to the decision maker.

Despite its importance, the SAN is one of the most poorly understood cardiac entities because of its small size and complex composition and function. The Hippo signaling pathway is a molecular signaling pathway fundamental to heart development and regeneration. Although abnormalities of the Hippo pathway are associated with cardiac arrhythmias in human patients, the role of this pathway in the SAN is unknown.We investigated key regulators of the Hippo pathway in SAN pacemaker cells by conditionally inactivating the Hippo signaling kinases Lats1 and Lats2 using the tamoxifen-inducible, cardiac conduction system-specific Cre driver Hcn42 with Lats1 and Lats2 conditional knockout alleles. In addition, the Hippo-signaling effectors Yap and Taz were conditionally inactivated in the SAN. To determine the function of Hippo signaling in the SAN and other cardiac conduction system components, we conducted a series of physiological and molecular experiments, including telemetry ECG recording, echocardiography, Masson Trichrome staining, calcium imaging, immunostaining, RNAscope, cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing using antibodies against Yap1 or H3K4me3, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. We also performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of various datasets.We found that Lats1/2 inactivation caused severe sinus node dysfunction. Compared with the controls, Lats1/2 conditional knockout mutants exhibited dysregulated calcium handling and increased fibrosis in the SAN, indicating that Lats1/2 function through both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. It is notable that the Lats1/2 conditional knockout phenotype was rescued by genetic deletion of Yap and Taz in the cardiac conduction system, and these rescued mice had normal sinus rhythm and reduced fibrosis of the SAN, indicating that Lats1/2 function through Yap and Taz cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing data showed that Yap potentially regulates genes critical for calcium homeostasis such as Ryr2 and genes encoding paracrine factors important in intercellular communication and fibrosis induction such as Tgfb1 and Tgfb3. Consistent with this, Lats1/2 conditional knockout mutants had decreased Ryr2 expression and increased Tgfb1 and Tgfb3 expression compared with control mice.We reveal, for the first time to our knowledge, that the canonical Hippo-Yap pathway plays a pivotal role in maintaining SAN homeostasis.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36317527": {"ArticleTitle": "All-cause and liver-related mortality risk factors in excessive drinkers: Analysis of data from the UK biobank.", "ArticleAbstract": "High alcohol intake is associated with increased mortality.

Siblings provide protection against infectious mononucleosis by occasionally preventing delayed primary Epstein-Barr virus infection with its associated high risk of infectious mononucleosis. Each additional sibling provides further protection according to the age difference between the index child and the sibling. The closer in age, the higher protection and with younger siblings being more protective against infectious mononucleosis than older siblings. If the hypothesis that delayed Epstein-Barr virus infection is necessary for the development of multiple sclerosis is true, then the relative risk of multiple sclerosis as a function of sibship constellation should mirror the relative risk of infectious mononucleosis as a function of sibship constellation. Such an indirect hypothesis test is necessitated by the fact that age at primary Epstein-Barr virus infection will be unknown for practically all people not having experienced infectious mononucleosis. In this retrospective cohort study using nation-wide registers, we followed all Danes born in 1971-2018 (n\u2009=\u20092,576,011) from 1977 through 2018 for hospital contacts with an infectious mononucleosis diagnosis (n\u2009=\u200923,905) or a multiple sclerosis diagnosis (n\u2009=\u20094,442), defining two different end points. Relative risks (hazard ratios) of each end point as a function of sibship constellation were obtained from stratified Cox regression analyses. The hazard ratios of interest for infectious mononucleosis and multiple sclerosis could be assumed identical (test for homogeneity P\u2009=\u20090.19), implying that having siblings especially of younger age may protect a person against multiple sclerosis through early exposure to Epstein-Barr virus. The maximum protection per sibling was obtained by having a 0-2 years younger sibling, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.80 with 95% confidence interval (0.76-0.85).

Prior methods have utilized MutS to enrich mutant DNA by hybridizing mutant to non-mutant DNA to create heteroduplexes. However, the purity of heteroduplex DNA these methods achieve is limited because they can only feasibly perform one or two enrichment cycles.

We determined sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity percentages in T1 melanomas according to the AJCC 8th Edition focusing on MR. Of the 313 T1 patients, 108 had MR\u2009=\u20090, 127 had MR\u2009=\u20091 and 78 had MR \u22652. The overall SLN positivity rate was 8.6%, (5.6% with MR\u2009=\u20090, 6.3% with MR\u2009=\u20091 and 16.7% with MR \u22652). The SLNB positivity rate in T1b melanomas was 12.1%, (8.5% with MR\u2009=\u20090, 5.7% with MR\u2009=\u20091 and 24.4% with MR \u22652), whereas in T1a melanomas it was 5.8%, (3.3% with MR\u2009=\u20090, 6.8% with MR\u2009=\u20091 and 8.1% with MR \u22652). In a logistic regression analysis, MR \u22652 had an odds ratio of almost three in comparison with MR\u2009=\u20090/1 also adjusting for thickness. Thus, MR \u22652 significantly predicted SLN metastases in T1 melanomas. Of those patients with positive SLN, 37% were classified as T1a according to the AJCC 8th edition.

The present study is investigating the mechanism of action of TCL1A in gastric cancer. TCL1A was lowly expressed in gastric cancer tissues.

Specifically, the MCPFM resolves the problem of unreliable predictions due to variable morphology and drastic scale variations of lesions by capturing the multi-scale global context of feature maps. Subsequently, the TFAEM overcomes the problem of blurred boundaries of lesions caused by the infiltrating growth and complex context of lesions by adaptively recalibrating and enhancing the multi-dimensional feature representation of suspicious regions.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the effect of PPI on the stem cell-like features of LCSCs and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LCSCs were enriched in a serum-free medium and treated with PPI, sorafenib (Sora), or PPI and Sora. Several endpoints, including spheroid formation and differentiation, cell proliferation, surface markers of LCSCs, PPI binding targets, and stemness-associated protein expression, were evaluated. Immunofluorescence staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, siRNA transfection, and coimmunoprecipitation ubiquitination assays were conducted for in-depth mechanistic studies. Evaluation of in vivo antitumor efficacy demonstrated that PPI effectively inhibited the proliferation of liver cancer cells and the self-renewal and differentiation of LCSCs. Flow cytometry indicated that PPI suppressed the expression of the stem cell surface markers EpCAM and CD13. Molecular docking showed a high affinity between PPI and proteins of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, including AKT, GSK-3\u03b2, and \u03b2-catenin, with the binding energies of -5.51, -5.32, and -5.40\u2009kcal/mol, respectively, which suggested that PPI might regulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway to affect the stem cell-like properties of HCC.

SI-2, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of SRC-3, was administered daily (2.5\u00a0mg/kg) to E0771 and 4T1 breast tumor-bearing immune-intact mice. In addition, SRC-3 knockdown (KD)-E0771 and SRC-3 KD-4T1 cells and their parental breast cancer cells were injected into their syngeneic immune-intact female mice versus immune-deficiency mice to validate that the host immune system is required for breast tumor suppression by SRC-3 KD in immune-intact mice.

Additionally, cytokine levels in SI-2-treated and SRC-3 KD E0771 breast tumors and their control cancers were defined with a Mouse Cytokine Array.SRC-3 inhibition by SI-2 significantly suppressed the progression of breast cancer cells (E0771 and 4T1) into breast cancers in immune-intact syngeneic female mice. SRC-3 KD-E0771 and -4T1 breast cancer cells did not produce well-developed tumors in immune-intact syngeneic female mice compared to their parental cells, but SRC-3 KD breast cancers were well developed in immune-defective host mice. SRC-3 inhibition by SI-2 and SRC-3 KD effectively increased the numbers of cytotoxic immune cells, such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD56+ NK cells, and Interferon \u03b3 (Ifng) in breast cancers compared to vehicle.

Many previous studies have reported an association between the ligation level of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) (high or low) and the incidence of AL after rectal cancer surgery. However, we cannot draw a solid conclusion because of the low quality and heterogeneity of those studies. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of the IMA ligation level on the occurrence of AL after minimally invasive anterior resection of rectal cancer.Patients with primary rectal cancer without distant metastases will be included after screening. They will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive high or low ligation of the IMA. The primary endpoint is AL incidence; secondary endpoints are quality of life; urinary, sexual, and defecatory functions; and 3-year disease-free survival. We hypothesized that the incidence rate of AL would be 15% and 5% in the high- and low-ligation groups, respectively.

The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence and clinicopathologic factors associated with risk of SPCs in BC survivors.We analyzed 171, 311 women with early-stage primary BC diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2015 from the Medicare-linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER-Medicare) database. SPC was defined as any diagnosis of malignancy occurring within the study period and at least 6 months after primary BC diagnosis.

Patient characteristics, anastomotic viability index (AVI) of the gastric conduit measured with thermal imaging, and operative outcomes were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test. Two propensity score weighting methods (inverse probability of treatment weighting and overlap weighting) were applied to investigate whether AMA reduces anastomotic leaks.Of the 293 patients who underwent an esophagectomy over the study period, 26 received AMA. AVI in the AMA group was significantly lower than that in the control group (0.64 vs. 0.74, p\u2009=\u20090.026). Overall anastomotic leak rates were 3.8% in the AMA group and 12.4% in the control group.

This multi-center retrospective study analyzed 53 cases of recurrent or metastatic inoperable HNSCC who had progressed or recurred after undergoing standard radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy treated with apatinib from March 2017 to August 2021. Patients continued apatinib until the time of disease progression or onset of intolerable adverse events. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) and incidence of adverse events. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine prognostic factors. The main adverse events were counted, and the severity of the adverse reactions was evaluated. Fifty-three patients with recurrent or metastatic inoperable R/M HNSCC who had progressed or recurred after standard radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy were included. The ORR was 15.1%, and the DCR was 86.8%. The median PFS was 4.4\u00a0months (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7-5.0\u00a0months) and the median OS was 6.6\u00a0months (95% CI 5.3-7.9\u00a0months).

The oxysterol (27HC) is produced via oxidation by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and metabolized via oxysterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) for bile acid synthesis in the liver. A previous study has demonstrated that treatment with the alternative Estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) ligand 27HC induces ER\u03b1-dependent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization. In addition, Cyp27a1-deficient mice demonstrate significantly reduced 27HC levels and HSC mobilization. Here, we report that exogenous 27HC treatment leads to a substantial reduction in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) population owing to significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis in the bone marrow (BM). However, 27HC does not influence the population of mature hematopoietic cells in the BM. Furthermore, exogenous 27HC treatment suppresses cell growth and promotes ROS production and apoptosis in leukemic cells. Moreover, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with high CYP7B1 expression (expected to have inhibition of 27HC) had significantly shorter survival than those with low CYP7B1 expression (expected to have an elevation of 27HC). Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA seq) analysis revealed that the expression of CYP7B1 was significantly increased in AML patients. Thus, our study suggests that 27HC may serve as a potent agent for regulating pools of HSPCs and may have an application as a novel therapeutic target for hematological malignancies.

However, strategies to deplete mutp53 are not well-established, and no HSP40/JDPs inhibitors are clinically available. To identify compounds that bind to DNAJA1 and induce mutp53 degradation, we performed an in silico docking study of ~10 million of compounds from the ZINC database for the J-domain of DNAJA1. A compound 7-3 was identified, and its analogue A11 effectively reduced the levels of DNAJA1 and conformational mutp53 with minimal effects on the levels of wild-type p53 and DNA-contact mutp53. A11 suppressed migration and filopodia formation in a manner dependent on DNAJA1 and conformational mutp53. A mutant DNAJA1 with alanine mutations at predicted amino acids (tyrosine 7, lysine 44, and glutamine 47) failed to bind to A11. Cells expressing the mutant DNAJA1 became insensitive to A11-mediated depletion of DNAJA1 and mutp53 as well as A11-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Thus, A11 is the first HSP40/JDP inhibitor that has not been previously characterized for depleting DNAJA1 and subsequently conformational mutp53, leading to inhibition of cancer cell migration.

Previous work from our group has demonstrated the presence of proinflammatory ARG2-specific CD4 T cells that inhibited tumor growth in murine models on activation with ARG2-derived peptides. In this study, we investigated the natural occurrence of ARG2-specific CD8 T cells in both healthy donors (HDs) and patients with cancer, along with their immunomodulatory capabilities in the context of the TME.A library of 15 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted ARG2-derived peptides were screened in HD peripheral blood mononuclear cells using interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) ELISPOT.

The reactivity of the cultures toward ARG2-expressing cells, including cancer cell lines and activated regulatory T cells (Tregs), was assessed using IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT and a chromium release assay. The Treg signature was validated based on proliferation suppression assays, flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR).

Almost half the studies focused on overdiagnosis (70; 45.5%), one-third on overuse of tests (61; 39.6%) and one-fifth on both (23; 14.9%). Common overdiagnosed conditions included malaria (61; 39.6%) and thyroid cancer (25; 16.2%), estimated to be >70% in China. Overused tests included imaging (n=25 studies) such as CT and MRI; laboratory investigations (n=18) such as serological tests and tumour markers; and procedures (n=14) such as colonoscopy. Drivers included fear of conflict with patients and expanding disease definitions.

To overcome PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in DCs, we developed a novel adeno-associated virus (meAAV) neoantigen vaccine, modified with TLR9 inhibitory fragments, PD-1 trap, and PD-L1 miRNA, which extend the persistence of meAAV and activate neoantigen-specific T-cell responses in immune-competent colorectal and breast cancer murine models.

These functional PD-1 traps and PD-L1 miRNAs overcome host PD1/PD-L1 inhibitory mechanisms and boost the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy. More importantly, combined radiotherapy and meAAV neoantigen cancer vaccines significantly enhanced neoantigen-specific CTL responses, increased CTL infiltration in tumor microenvironment, and decreased tumor-associated immunosuppression.

Additionally, gene expression data at the single-cell level of leukemic cells of primary patients at the diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) up to 30 days from the standard treatments reveal that the expression of \u03b2-Catenin and FOXO3 dependent genes is present in the CD82+CD117+ cell fraction, which is substantially enriched with LICs in MRD as well as in early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL).

In the present study, we aimed to establish a potential relationship between JAK/STAT3 signaling activation and clinicopathologic features in ALK- ALCLs, and further recognize the heterogenous nature of these neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry staining of the phosphorylated-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and dual-specificity protein phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) gene rearrangement analysis were performed. Forty-five cases of ALK- ALCL were divided into 3 groups, including 9 DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs, 21 p-STAT3+ double-negative (DN) ALCLs (both ALK and DUSP22 rearrangement negative), and 15 p-STAT3- DN-ALCLs. Morphologically, p-STAT3+ DN-ALCLs exhibited sheet-like neoplastic cells and sometimes showed large pleomorphic cells scattered in a lymphocyte-rich background more frequently than those in other ALK- ALCLs subtypes. Phenotypically, the p-STAT3+ DN-ALCLs frequently expressed cytotoxic molecules, epithelial membrane antigen, and programmed death-ligand 1, whereas CD3 and CD5 expression was not observed. Clinically, patients with p-STAT3+ DN-ALCLs had a better prognosis than those with p-STAT3- DN-ALCLs. These observations suggest that p-STAT3+ DN-ALCLs represent a distinct subtype of ALK- ALCLs.

The complexes play critical roles in cell proliferation, survival, migration, metabolism, and DNA damage response. This study investigated the aberrant mTORC2 signaling pathway in GBM cells by performing quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of U87MG cells under different drug treatment conditions. Interestingly, a functional analysis of phosphoproteome revealed that mTORC2 inhibition might be involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair. We further characterized the relationship between mTORC2 and BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 1 (BABAM1). We demonstrated that pBABAM1 at Ser29 is regulated by mTORC2 to initiate DNA damage response, contributing to DNA repair and cancer cell survival. Accordingly, the inactivation of mTORC2 significantly ablated pBABAM1 (Ser29), reduced DNA repair activities in the nucleus, and promoted apoptosis of the cancer cells. Furthermore, we also recognized that histone H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 (\u03b3H2AX) could be controlled by mTORC2 to repair the DNA.

Knock-down of Syngap1 reversed memory deficits in Mnk DKO mice, and pharmacological inhibition of Mnks rescued autism-related phenotypes in Syngap1+/- mice.

However, the consequences of these different mechanisms for the regulation of protein expression remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed systematic measurements on the uORF-containing 5' UTR of the cytomegaloviral UL4 mRNA to test alternative models of uORF-mediated regulation in human cells. We find that a terminal diproline-dependent elongating ribosome stall in the UL4 uORF prevents decreases in main ORF protein expression when ribosome loading onto the mRNA is reduced. This uORF-mediated buffering is insensitive to the location of the ribosome stall along the uORF. Computational kinetic modeling based on our measurements suggests that scanning ribosomes dissociate rather than queue when they collide with stalled elongating ribosomes within the UL4 uORF. We identify several human uORFs that repress main ORF protein expression via a similar terminal diproline motif.

We formally derive the continuum counterpart of this model, which is given by a coupled system that comprises an integro-differential equation for the density of tumour cells, a partial differential equation for the density of T cells and a partial differential equation for the concentration of chemokines. We report on computational results of the hybrid model and show that there is an excellent quantitative agreement between them and numerical solutions of the corresponding continuum model. These results shed light on the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of different levels of infiltration of T cells into the tumour and elucidate how T-cell infiltration shapes anti-tumour immune response. Moreover, to present a proof of concept for the idea that, exploiting the computational efficiency of the continuum model, extensive numerical simulations could be carried out, we investigate the impact of T-cell infiltration on the response of tumour cells to different types of anti-cancer immunotherapy.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": ["Humans", "Computer Simulation", "Models, Biological", "Mathematical Concepts", "Neoplasms", "Immunity", "Chemokines"]}, "36315356": {"ArticleTitle": "Wide-field radiation therapy for skin cancerisation - Have we forgotten what we learned?", "ArticleAbstract": "", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36315351": {"ArticleTitle": "A narrative review on the non-surgical treatment of chronic postoperative inguinal pain: a challenge for both surgeon and anaesthesiologist.", "ArticleAbstract": "Chronic pain is one of the most frequent clinical problems after inguinal hernia surgery.

Randomized controlled trials have found that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are associated with fewer recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) events and an increased risk of bleeding than low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) in CAT. With new clinical data available, this study aims to assess the comparative cost-effectiveness of DOACs and LMWHs over 6- and 60-month treatment durations from the US healthcare system and societal perspectives.A Markov model for cancer patients eligible to receive rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban, enoxaparin, or dalteparin was used to conduct a cost-utility analysis. Clinical scenarios were analyzed based on 6- and 60-month time horizons from the US healthcare system and societal perspectives. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost in US dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results.DOACs were cost-saving and clinically superior to LMWHs and were associated with a cost change ranging from -\u00a0$9134.66 to -\u00a0$15,281.92 and incremental effectiveness of 0.43-1.25 QALYs among four clinical scenarios. The most influential model inputs for ICER were the utility associated with LMWH use and probabilities of non-VTE and non-bleeding related death. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were consistent with the results.DOACs were found to dominate LMWHs, suggesting that DOACs may be a cost-effective alternative to LMWHs for CAT.

We utilized a tail vein injection model of metastasis to evaluate the effect of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PIM3 knockout, stable overexpression of PIM3, and pharmacologic PIM inhibition on the formation of lung metastasis. In vivo studies revealed PIM3 knockout impaired the formation of lung metastasis: 5 out of 6 mice injected with wild type hepatoblastoma cells developed lung metastasis while none of the 7 mice injected with PIM3 knockout hepatoblastoma cells developed lung metastasis. PIM3 overexpression in hepatoblastoma increased the pulmonary metastatic burden in mice and mechanistically, upregulated the phosphorylation and cell surface expression of CXCR4, a key receptor in the progression of cancer cell metastasis. CXCR4 blockade with AMD3100 decreased the metastatic phenotype of PIM3 overexpressing cells, indicating that CXCR4 contributed to PIM3's promotion of hepatoblastoma metastasis. Clinically, PIM3 expression correlated positively with CXCR4 expression in primary hepatoblastoma tissues.

Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs sporadically in 85% of cases with the remaining cases associated with multiple familial syndromes. The pathologic manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism include parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, and parathyroid carcinoma. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of parathyroid disease has helped to refine the diagnosis and classification of parathyroid lesions. The identification of multiple clonal proliferations in traditional multiglandular parathyroid hyperplasia has led to the adoption by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the alternate term of primary hyperparathyroidism-related multiglandular parathyroid disease. Additional nomenclature changes include the adoption of the term atypical parathyroid tumor in lieu of atypical parathyroid adenoma to reflect the uncertain malignant potential of these neoplasms. Clinical and morphologic features characteristic of familial disease have been described that can help the practicing pathologist identify underlying familial disease and provide appropriate management. Use of ancillary immunohistochemistry and molecular studies can be helpful in classifying parathyroid neoplasms. Parafibromin has proven useful as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in atypical parathyroid tumors and parathyroid carcinomas.

For patients who are ultimately unable to afford DOACs, this may lead to unnecessary financial burden or abandoning prescriptions at the pharmacy, placing them at continued risk of stroke.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36315121": {"ArticleTitle": "Parent Perceptions of a Pretend Play Intervention for Their Children With Cancer.", "ArticleAbstract": "Although the rate of survival in childhood cancer today is close to 85%, a cancer diagnosis can still turn the world upside down for both children and parents. Often, children in oncology care are frustrated about their inability to control events and activities around them. Therapeutic pretend play has been suggested as a means to encourage children to express and handle emotions in a safe environment.This study was developed to describe and explore parents' experiences of a pretend play intervention that consisted of six to eight play sessions with a play facilitator administered to their children undergoing cancer treatment.A descriptive qualitative method was used, including individual interviews with 15 parents.Three main categories were developed, including (a) experiences of joining the project, (b) perceptions of the play intervention, and (c) reflections on effects and implications, with subcategories evolved for each category. The parents experienced that the play sessions helped improve their children's communication skills and made them more capable of participating in their care. They appreciated that the intervention focused on the child's well-being and saw it as a positive break in their child's cancer treatment. It also helped them better reflect on their own situation.According to the parents' experiences, pretend play can be a helpful tool for improving children's participation in their cancer care that strengthens their autonomy, emotional repertoire, and communication skills. However, the results also highlighted that some of the children did not fully understand the information provided about this study, which weakened the validity of their consent to participate. Thus, more work is needed on developing age-appropriate information to obtain participation consent from children.

Herein, an optical gas pressure sensor based on a silver/polydimethylsiloxane (Ag/PDMS) bilayer system was designed as a signal transducer to read the concentration of the detection target alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) quantitatively. In this proposed pressure-based assay, silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanospheres decorated with platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were coupled to detect antibodies by covalent linkage, and the captured antibodies were conjugated with magnetic beads via streptavidin-biotin interaction, simultaneously. When the AFP was loaded, the Pt-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition reaction was triggered to induce a significant increase in the reflectance signal of the Ag/PDMS bilayer gas pressure sensor (BGPS) due to a \"wrinkled-specular\" transition of the Ag film's surface. Under optimal conditions, the pressure-based biosensor exhibited a broad linear detection range from 0.05 to 132 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.016 ng mL-1 for AFP, which satisfies the requirements for the clinical detection of AFP.

In cancer cells, the two redox pairs recycle each other and dramatically promote the intracellular reactive oxygen species production to kill cancer cells at low doses comparable to cytotoxic drugs. Oppositely in noncancer cells, the LA/DHLA and VC/DHA pairs exert anti-oxidant action to actively protect the organism by preventing the normal cells from oxidative stress and repairing cells suffering from oxidative stress.

Attenuation of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is more prevalent than once appreciated, targeting 10-15% of mRNA genes in yeast through higher eukaryotes, but its significance and mechanism remain obscure. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, Pol II attenuation was initially shown to rely on Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 termination, but more recently our lab characterized a hybrid termination pathway involving Hrp1, an RNA-binding protein in the 3'-end cleavage factor (CF). One of the hybrid attenuation gene targets is DEF1, which encodes a repair protein that promotes degradation of Pol II stalled at DNA lesions. In this study we characterized the chromosomal DEF1 attenuator and the functional role of Hrp1. DEF1 attenuator mutants overexpressed Def1 mRNA and protein, exacerbated Pol II degradation, and hindered cell growth, supporting a biologically significant DEF1 attenuator function. Using an auxin-induced Hrp1 depletion system, we identified new Hrp1-dependent attenuators in MNR2, SNG1, and RAD3 genes. An hrp1-5 mutant (L205S) known to impair binding to CF protein Rna14 also disrupted attenuation, but surprisingly no widespread defect was observed for an hrp1-1 mutant (K160E) located in the RNA recognition motif (RRM). We designed a new RRM mutant (hrp1-F162W) that altered a highly conserved residue and was lethal in single copy. In a heterozygous strain, hrp1-F162W exhibited dominant-negative read through defects at multiple gene attenuators.

Tumour sequencing thus presents an orthogonal approach to assess the role of candidate genes in BC development.Exome sequencing was performed on paired normal-breast tumour DNA from 124 carriers of germline loss-of-function (LoF) or missense (MS) mutations carriers in 15 known and candidate BC predisposition genes identified in the BEACCON case-control study. Bi-allelic inactivation and association with tumour genome features including mutational signatures and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score were investigated.BARD1-carrying TN BC (4/5) displayed bi-allelic loss and associated high HRD scores and mutational signature 3, as did a RAD51D-carrying TN BC and ovarian cancer. Bi-allelic loss was less frequent in BRIP1 BCs (4/13) and had low HRD scores. In contrast to other established BC genes, BCs from carriers of CHEK2 LoF (6/17) or MS (2/20) carriers had low rates of bi-allelic loss. Exploratory analysis of BC from carriers of LoF mutations in candidate genes such as BLM, FANCM, PARP2 and RAD50 found little evidence of bi-allelic inactivation.BARD1 and RAD51D behave as classic BRCA-like genes with bi-allelic inactivation but this was not observed for any of the candidate genes.

Comparative genomics, utilizing Rattus norvegicus strains differing in susceptibility to mammary tumor development, is a complimentary approach to identify breast cancer susceptibility genes. Mammary carcinoma susceptibility 3 (Mcs3) is a Copenhagen (COP/NHsd) allele that confers resistance to mammary carcinomas when introgressed into a mammary carcinoma susceptible Wistar Furth (WF/NHsd) genome. Here Mcs3 was positionally mapped to a 7.2\u2009Mb region of RNO1 spanning rs8149408 to rs107402736 (Chr1:143700228-150929594, build 6.0/rn6) using WF.COP congenic strains and DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Male and female WF.COP-Mcs3 rats had significantly lower body mass compared to the WF strain. The effect on female body mass was observed only when females were raised in the absence of males indicating a socioenvironmental interaction. Furthermore, female WF.COP-Mcs3 rats, raised in the absence of males, did not develop enhanced lobuloalveolar morphologies compared to those observed in the WF strain.

However, the CDT is substantially hindered by glutathione (GSH) scavenging effect on \u00b7OH, low intracellular H2O2 level, and low reaction rate, resulting in unsatisfactory efficacy. Here, a cancer cell membrane (CM)-camouflaged Au nanorod core/mesoporous MnO2 shell yolk-shell nanocatalyst embedded with glucose oxidase (GOD) and Dox (denoted as AMGDC) is constructed for synergistic triple-augmented CDT and chemotherapy of tumor under MRI/PAI guidance. Benefiting from the homologous adhesion and immune escaping property of the cancer CM, the nanocatalysts can target tumor and gradually accumulate in tumor site. For triple-augmented CDT, first, the MnO2 shell reacts with intratumoral GSH to generate Mn2+ and glutathione disulfide, which achieves Fenton-like ion delivery and weakening of GSH-mediated scavenging effect, leading to GSH depletion-enhanced CDT. Second, the intratumoral glucose can be oxidized to H2O2 and gluconic acid by GOD, achieving supplementary H2O2-enhanced CDT. Next, the AuNRs absorbing in NIR-II elevate the local tumor temperature upon NIR-II laser irradiation, achieving photothermal-enhanced CDT. Dox is rapidly released for adjuvant chemotherapy due to responsive degradation of MnO2 shell. Moreover, GSH-activated PAI/MRI can be used to monitor CDT process.

Multiple analytic approaches were employed to normalize sequencing data.Normalized TCR richness was significantly lower in post-TIL than pre-TIL, suggesting that cetuximab reduced TCR diversity and promoted TCR expansion in TIL samples, regardless of response status.

Similar responses were observed in HPV-16-infected SCC-47 and HPV-16-negative HSC-3 oral epithelial cancer cells that were cultured with these viral proteins.

These results suggest that the interaction of HIV-1 with neoplastic epithelial cells may lead to their de-differentiation into cancer stem cells that are resistant to apoptosis and anti-cancer drugs. Thus, this pathway may play a critical role in the development of invasive cancer. Inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 and MAPK signaling and vimentin expression, and restoration of E-cadherin expression reduced HIV-induced EMT and the invasiveness of HPV-16-immortalized anal and cervical epithelial cells. Taken together, these results suggest that these approaches might be exploited to limit the role of HIV-1 infection in the acceleration of HPV-associated or HPV-independent epithelial neoplasia.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36314945": {"ArticleTitle": "HCV Infection Increases the Expression of ACE2 Receptor, Leading to Enhanced Entry of Both HCV and SARS-CoV-2 into Hepatocytes and a Coinfection State.", "ArticleAbstract": "Recent studies suggest the enhancement of liver injury in COVID-19 patients infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatocytes express low levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, raising the possibility of HCV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in the liver. This work aimed to explore whether HCV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfect hepatocytes and the interplay between these viruses. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 coinfects HCV-infected Huh7.5 (Huh7.5HCV) cells. Both viruses replicated efficiently in the coinfected cells, with HCV replication enhanced in coinfected compared to HCV-mono-infected cells. Strikingly, Huh7.5HCV cells were eight fold more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses than naive Huh7.5 cells, suggesting enhanced SARS-CoV-2 entry into HCV-preinfected hepatocytes. In addition, we observed increased binding of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein to Huh7.5HCV cells, as well as enhanced cell-to-cell fusion of Huh7.5HCV cells with spike-expressing Huh7.5 cells. We explored the mechanism of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 entry and identified an increased ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in Huh7.5HCV cells, primary hepatocytes, and in data from infected liver biopsies obtained from database. Importantly, higher expression of ACE2 increased HCV infection by enhancing its binding to the host cell, underscoring its role in the HCV life cycle as well. Transcriptome analysis revealed that shared host signaling pathways were induced in HCV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. This study revealed complex interactions between HCV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in hepatocytes, which may lead to the increased liver damage recently reported in HCV-positive COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for the coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with HCV, and the interplay between them. The study revealed a complex relationship of enhancement between the two viruses, where HCV infection increased the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, thus facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry, and potentially, also HCV entry. Thereafter, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhanced HCV replication in hepatocytes. This study may explain the aggravation of liver damage that was recently reported in COVID-19 patients with HCV coinfection and suggests preinfection with HCV as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Moreover, it highlights the possible importance of HCV treatment for coinfected patients. In a broader view, these findings emphasize the importance of identifying coinfecting pathogens that increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and that may accelerate COVID-19-related co-morbidities.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36314942": {"ArticleTitle": "Transient Systemic Autophagy Ablation Irreversibly Inhibits Lung Tumor Cell Metabolism and Promotes T-Cell Mediated Tumor Killing.", "ArticleAbstract": "Macroautophagy/autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process pivotal to cellular homeostasis and support of tumorigenesis.

We utilized inducible expression of Atg5 shRNA to temporally control autophagy levels in a reversible manner to study the effects of tumor-intrinsic and systemic autophagic loss and restoration on established Kras;trp53 (KP) lung tumor growth. We reported that transient systemic ATG5 loss significantly reduces KP lung tumor growth. Through in vivo isotope tracing and metabolic flux analyses, we noted that systemic ATG5 knockdown significantly reduces the uptake of glucose and lactate in lung tumors, leading to impaired TCA cycle metabolism and biosynthesis. Additionally, we observed an increased tumor T cell infiltration in the absence of systemic ATG5, which is essential for T cell-mediated tumor killing. Moreover, the impaired tumor metabolism and increased T cell infiltration are sustained when autophagy is restored in a short term. Finally, we found that intermittent systemic ATG5 knockdown, a mock therapy situation, significantly prolongs the lifespan of mice bearing KP lung tumors.

In this work, we examined the effect of ethanol shock on the transcriptome and metabolome of Streptomyces venezuelae NRRL B-65442 using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Ethanol shock caused massive changes in the gene expression profile, differentially affecting genes for secondary metabolite biosynthesis and central metabolic pathways. Most of the data from the transcriptome analysis correlated well with the metabolome changes, including the overproduction of jadomycin congeners and a downshift in the production of desferrioxamines, legonoxamine, foroxymithin, and a small cryptic ribosomally synthesized peptide. Some of the metabolome changes, such as the overproduction of chloramphenicol, could not be explained by overexpression of the cognate biosynthetic genes but correlated with the expression profiles of genes for precursor biosynthesis. Changes in the transcriptome were also observed for several genes known to play a role in stress response in other bacteria and included at least 10 extracytoplasmic function \u03c3 factors. This study provides important new insights into the stress response in antibiotic-producing bacteria and will help to understand the complex mechanisms behind the environmental factor-induced regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. IMPORTANCE Streptomyces spp. are filamentous Gram-positive bacteria known as versatile producers of secondary metabolites, of which some have been developed into human medicines against infections and cancer. The genomes of these bacteria harbor dozens of gene clusters governing the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (BGCs), of which most are not expressed under laboratory conditions. Detailed knowledge of the complex regulation of BGC expression is still lacking, although certain growth conditions are known to trigger the production of previously undetected secondary metabolites. In this work, we investigated the effect of ethanol shock on the production of secondary metabolites by Streptomyces venezuelae and correlated these findings with the expression of cognate BGCs and primary metabolic pathways involved in the generation of cofactors and precursors.

Mechanistically, we demonstrate that mitochondrial PHGDH directly interacts with adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) and then recruits mitochondrial elongation factor G2 (mtEFG2) to promote mitochondrial ribosome recycling efficiency, thereby promoting mtDNA-encoded protein expression and subsequent mitochondrial respiration.

In healthy individuals, primary infection with herpesviruses is followed by latency, and occasional subclinical reactivation ensures transmission and contributes to an emerging pool of memory T cells. In immunocompromised individuals, herpesviruses can be life threatening. However, knowledge about the spectrum of virus-specific cytokine responses is limited. Here, we investigated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from children with differential carrier statuses for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) (n\u2009=\u200932, age 1 to 17\u2009years). We examined memory T cell subsets as well as IFN-\u03b3-, IL-10-, IL-17A-, and IL-22-producing T cells after polyclonal activation or stimulation with viral peptides using flow cytometry and a 4-parameter FluoroSpot assay. Age and herpesvirus carriage influenced the size of the memory T cell subsets. A positive association between age and the number of IFN-\u03b3-, IL-17A- and IL-22-producing T cells was found following polyclonal activation. For CMV, age was positively associated with IL-17A spot-forming cells (SFC), while for VZV, age was negatively associated with IL-22 and positively associated with IFN-\u03b3 SFC. Upon activation with CMV, VZV, and EBV peptides, IFN-\u03b3 SFCs dominated. Notably, VZV responses were characterized by a higher IL-10 SFC population compared to both CMV and EBV. Our findings suggest that cytokine responses vary across herpesvirus-type-specific memory T cells and may more adequately reflect their composition. An observed deviation between polyclonal and herpesvirus-specific T cell cytokine responses in children needs to be considered when interpreting the associations between herpesvirus carrier status and bulk T cell reactivity. In summary, these findings may have implications for the treatment of immunocompromised patients. IMPORTANCE Infection with herpesviruses accounts for 35 to 40 billion human cases worldwide. Despite this, little is known about how herpesviruses shape the immune system in the asymptomatic carrier. Particularly in children, primary infection is connected to no or mild symptoms ahead of latency for life. Most research on cellular responses against herpesviruses focuses on inflammatory cytokines associated with antiproliferative and antitumor mechanisms and not the spectrum of cytokine responses in healthy humans. This study investigated four divergent cytokine-producing T cell responses to herpesviruses, reflecting different immunological functions. Three common childhood herpesviruses were selected: Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus. Curiously, not all viruses induced the same pattern of cytokines. Varicella-zoster responses were characterized by IL-10, which is considered regulatory. Besides broadening understanding of responses to herpesviruses, our results raise the possibility that reactivation of varicella-zoster may be counterproductive in cancer treatment through the action of IL-10-producing T-cells.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36314821": {"ArticleTitle": "Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated Is Activated but Not Required for Productive Autographa californica Multiple Nucleopolyhedrovirus Infection.", "ArticleAbstract": "Multiplication of the invertebrate DNA baculoviruses activates the host DNA damage response (DDR), which promotes virus DNA replication. DDR signaling is initiated by the host insect's phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), including ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM). Like other PIKKs, ATM phosphorylates an array of host DDR proteins at serine/threonine glutamine (S/TQ) motifs, the result of which leads to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. To define the role of host PIKKs in baculovirus replication, we compared replication levels of the baculovirus prototype species Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus in permissive Spodoptera frugiperda (SF21) cells with and without ATM function. Caffeine, which inhibits multiple DDR kinases, and the ATM-specific inhibitors KU-55933 and KU-60019 each prevented phosphorylation of Spodoptera histone H2AX (SfH2AX), a recognized indicator of ATM activity. However, only caffeine reduced autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV)-induced bulk phosphorylation of S/TQ protein motifs. Furthermore, only caffeine, not KU-55933 or KU-60019, reduced AcMNPV yields, suggesting a limited role for ATM. To investigate further, we identified and edited the Spodoptera ATM gene (sfatm). Consistent with ATM's known functions, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of sfatm eliminated DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of DDR marker SfH2AX in SF21 cells. However, loss of sfatm failed to affect the levels of AcMNPV multiplication. These findings suggested that in the absence of the kinase SfATM, another caffeine-sensitive host DDR kinase promotes S/TQ phosphorylation and baculovirus multiplication. Thus, baculoviruses activate and utilize the host insect DDR in an ATM-independent manner. IMPORTANCE The DDR, while necessary for the maintenance and fidelity of the host genome, represents an important cellular response to viral infection. The prolific DNA baculoviruses activate and manipulate the invertebrate DDR by using mechanisms that positively impact virus multiplication, including virus DNA replication. As the key DDR initiator kinase, ATM was suspected to play a critical role in this host response. However, we show here that baculovirus AcMNPV activates an ATM-independent DDR. By identifying the insect host ATM ortholog (Spodoptera frugiperda SfATM) and evaluating genetic knockouts, we show that SfATM is dispensable for AcMNPV activation of the DDR and for virus replication. Thus, another PIKK, possibly the closely related kinase ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related kinase), is responsible for efficient baculovirus multiplication.

The recent advent of immunotherapies showing remarkable clinical efficacies against various cancer types offers the possibility of novel opportunities also for metastatic PPGL. Most PPGL are pathogenically linked to inactivating mutations in genes encoding different succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits. This causes activation of the hypoxia inducible factor 2 (HIF2)-mediated transcriptional program in the absence of decreased intratumoral oxygen levels, a phenomenon known as pseudohypoxia. Genuine hypoxia in a tumor creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, the impact of pseudohypoxia in the immune landscape of tumors remains largely unexplored. In this study, tumoral expression of PD-L1 and HIF2\u03b1, and tumor infiltration of CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL) was examined in PPGL specimens from 102 patients. We assessed associations between PD-L1, CTL infiltration, HIF2\u03b1 expression and the mutational status of SDH genes. Our results show that high PD-L1-expression levels in tumor cells and CTL tumor infiltration was more frequent in metastatic than non-metastatic PPGL. However, this phenotype was negatively associated with SDH-mutations and high HIF2\u03b1 protein expression. These data were validated by analysis of mRNA levels of genes expressing PD-L1, CD8 and HIF2\u03b1 in PPGL included in the TCGA database. Further, PD-L1 and CD8 expression was lower in norepinephrine than epinephrine-secreting PPGL. This in silico analysis also revealed the low PD-L1 or CD8 expression levels in tumors with inactivating mutations in VHL or activating mutations in the HIF2\u03b1-coding gene, EPAS1, which, together with SDH-mutated tumors, comprise the pseudohypoxic molecular subtype of PPGL. These findings suggest that pseudohypoxic tumor cells induce extrinsic signaling towards the immune cells promoting the development of an immunosuppressive environment. It also provides compelling support to explore the differential response of metastatic PPGL to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This article is protected by copyright.

The field size is unclear but may represent a large area of tissue, and the origin of mutations is also unclear. Here, we analyzed whole exome and transcriptome features in contralateral tumor-distal tongue (i.e. distant from the tumor, not tumor-adjacent) and corresponding tumor tissues from 15 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue. The number of point mutations ranged from 41 to 237 in tumors and from 1 to 78 in tumor-distal samples. Tumor-distal samples showed mainly clock-like (associated with aging) or tobacco smoking mutational signatures. Tumors additionally showed mutations that associate with cytidine deaminase AID/APOBEC enzyme activities, or a UV-like signature. Importantly, no point mutations were shared between a tumor and the matched tumor-distal sample in any patient. TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene in tumors (67%), whereas TP53 mutation was detected in only one tumor-distal sample and this mutation was not shared with the matched tumor. Arm-level copy number variation (CNV) was found in 12 tumors, with loss of chromosome (Chr) 8p and/or gain of 8q being the most frequent events. Two tumor-distal samples showed gain of Chr8, which was associated with increased expression of Chr8-located genes in these samples although gene ontology did not show a role for these genes in oncogenic processes. In situ hybridization revealed a mixed pattern of Chr8 gain and neutral copy number in both tumor cells and adjacent non-tumor epithelium in one patient. We conclude that distant field cancerization exists but does not present as tumor-related mutational events.

Pah1 function is mainly regulated via control of its cellular location by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Pah1 phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases is sequestered in the cytosol apart from its substrate PA in the membrane. The phosphorylated Pah1 is then recruited and dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase complex Nem1 (catalytic subunit)-Spo7 (regulatory subunit) in the endoplasmic reticulum. The dephosphorylated Pah1 hops onto and scoots along the membrane to recognize PA for its dephosphorylation to DAG. Here, we developed a proteoliposome model system that mimics the Nem1-Spo7/Pah1 phosphatase cascade to provide a tool for studying Pah1 regulation. Purified Nem1-Spo7 was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles prepared in accordance with the phospholipid composition of the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

Sixty specimens were obtained (50 transurethral resections, 7 aquablations, 3 laser enucleations), from 17 different surgeons. Seven specimens had concurrent genitourinary pathology (4 prostatic adenocarcinoma, 1 solitary fibrous tumor, 1 prostatic atypia, 1 urothelial carcinoma in situ). The extent of cystic change among overall tissue examined ranged from 1\u2005mm-8\u2005mm (mean 3.4\u2005mm), with luminal content of cystic spaces characterized as empty (72%), both empty and fluid-like (17%), and both empty and mucin-like (11%; mucin histochemical stain was negative on all specimens).

Upon 808\u00a0nm photoirradiation, UCNPs emit at the blue region to photoactivate the EcN for secretion of flaB, which subsequently binds to Toll-like receptor 5 expressed on the membrane of macrophages for activating immune response via MyD88-dependent signal pathway. Such synergism leads to significant tumor regression in different tumor models and metastatic tumors with negligible side effects.

However, most NIR-II NPs exhibit low phototheranostic efficiency due to their tedious synthetic routes, large particle sizes (> 20\u00a0nm), and lack of active targeting properties. Here, we report a miniature NIR-II NPs, named HSA-ICG-iRGD, for active-targeted NIR-II phototheranostics of brain tumors. The HSA-ICG-iRGD probes are designed based on hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds between albumin and indocyanine green derivatives (ICG-iRGD) via molecular docking. The as-prepared NPs have a compact size of 10\u00a0nm and show tumor-targeting ability by specifically binding to \u03b1v \u03b23 integrin receptors which are highly expressed on the surface of brain tumor cells via iRGD peptides. The HSA-ICG-iRGD NPs are then applied to perform active-targeted NIR-II fluorescence imaging, resulting in a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 6.85 in orthotopic glioma mouse models. Under the selected laser irradiation of 808\u00a0nm, the photothermal effect of HSA-ICG-iRGD extend the survival of the tumor-bearing mice to 55 days, significantly longer than that of the control group (30 days).

However, the construction of the pseudo-partial score function ignores the dependency among recurrent events and thus can be inefficient. An attempt to investigate the asymptotic efficiency of weighted pseudo-partial likelihood estimation found that the optimal weight function involves the unknown variance-covariance process of the recurrent event process and may not have closed-form expression. Thus, instead of deriving the optimal weights, we propose to combine a system of pre-specified weighted pseudo-partial score equations\u00a0via the generalized method of moments and empirical likelihood estimation.

This value is higher than human tissue oxygen levels, as the in vivo oxygen partial pressures range from 104 mmHg (lung alveoli) to 8 mmHg (skin epidermis). Importantly, under pathological conditions such as cancer, cells can experience oxygen pressure lower than the healthy tissue. Although hypoxic incubators can regulate gas oxygen, they do not take into account the dissolved oxygen concentration in the cell culture medium. In the context of organ on chip and micro-physiological system development, we present here a new system, called Oxalis (OXygen ALImentation System) that allows fine control of the dissolved oxygen level in the cell culture medium. Oxalis regulates simultaneously the gas composition and the inlet reservoir pressure by modulating the pneumatic valve opening. This dual regulation allows both the pressure driven liquid flowrate and the level of oxygen dissolved in the chip to be controlled independently. Oxalis offers unprecedented features such as an oxygen equilibration time lower than 3 minutes and an accuracy of 3 mmHg. These performances can be reached for chip perfusion flow as low as 1 \u03bcL min-1. This low flow rate allows the shear stress experienced by the cells in the chip to be accurately controlled. In addition, the system enables modulation of the pH in the cell culture medium through the modulation of CO2. The fine control and monitoring of both O2 and pH pave the way for new precise investigations on physiological and pathological biological processes. Using Oxalis in the context of tumor-on-chip, we demonstrate the capacity of the system to recapitulate hypoxia-induced gene expression, offering an innovative strategy for future studies on the role of hypoxia in malignant progression and drug resistance.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36314257": {"ArticleTitle": "Preparation of nanoscale cationic metal-organic framework Nano Mn(III)-TP for theranostics based on valence changes.", "ArticleAbstract": "A single treatment strategy to produce a significant effect on cancer treatment is difficult due to the complex variability of the tumor environment.

Meanwhile, either forced expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in or hypoxic culture of glioblastoma cells result in enhanced expression of Ror1 in the cells. Consistently, we show that both NICD and HIF1\u03b1 bind to upstream regions within the Ror1 gene more efficiently in GSCs under spheroid culture conditions. Furthermore, we provide evidence, indicating that binding of Wnt5a to Ror1, up-regulated by Notch and hypoxia signaling pathways in GSCs, might promote their spheroid-forming ability.

Pharmacologic inhibition of TKT could impede HCC development and enhance treatment efficacy. However, no safe and effective TKT inhibitor has been approved.An online two-dimensional TKT protein immobilised biochromatographic system was established for high-throughput screening of TKT ligands. Oroxylin A was found to specifically bind TKT. Drug affinity responsive target stability, cellular thermal shift assay, surface plasmon resonance, molecular docking, competitive displacement assay, and site mutation were performed to identify the binding of oroxylin A with TKT. Antitumour effects of oroxylin A were evaluated in vitro, in human xenograft mice, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mice, and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Metabolomic analysis was applied to detect the enzyme activity. Transcriptome profiling was conducted to illustrate the anti-HCC mechanism of oroxylin A. TKT knocking-down HCC cell lines and PDOs were established to evaluate the role of TKT in oroxylin A-induced HCC suppression.By targeting TKT, oroxylin A stabilised the protein to proteases and temperature extremes, decreased its activity and expression, resulted in accumulation of non-oxidative PPP substrates, and activated p53 signalling. In addition, oroxylin A suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, and inhibited the growth of human xenograft tumours and DEN-induced HCC in mice. Crucially, TKT depletion exerted identical effects to oroxylin A, and the promising inhibitor also exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy against clinically relevant HCC PDOs.These results uncover a unique role for oroxylin A in TKT inhibition, which directly targets TKT and suppresses the non-oxidative PPP.

While the sensory component processes information about stimulus location and intensity, the affective component processes information regarding pain-related expectations, motivation to reduce pain, and pain unpleasantness. Unlike investigations of acute pain that are based on the introduction of real-time stimulus during brain recordings, chronic pain investigations are usually based on longitudinal and case-control studies, which are limited in their ability to infer the functional network topology of chronic pain. In the current study, we utilized the unique opportunity to target the central nervous system's pain pathways in two different hierarchical locations to establish causality between pain relief and specific connectivity changes seen within the salience and sensorimotor networks. We examined how lesions to the affective and somatic pain pathways affect resting-state network topology in cancer patients suffering from severe intractable pain. Two procedures have been employed: percutaneous cervical cordotomy (n\u2009=\u200915), hypothesized to disrupt the transmission of the sensory component of pain along the spino-thalamic tract, or stereotactic cingulotomy (n\u2009=\u20097), which refers to bilateral intra-cranial ablation of an area in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and is known to ameliorate the affective component of pain. Both procedures led to immediate significant alleviation of experienced pain and decreased functional connectivity within the salience network. However, only the sensory procedure (cordotomy) led to decreased connectivity within the sensorimotor network.

Despite the significant role of radiotherapy (RT) as a curative approach for many solid tumors, tumor recurrence occurs, partially because of intrinsic radioresistance. Accumulating evidence indicates that the success of RT is hampered by activation of the DNA damage response (DDR). The intensity of DDR signaling is affected by multiple parameters, e.g., loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes, gain-of-function mutations in protooncogenes as well as radiation-induced alterations in signal-transduction pathways. Therefore, the response to irradiation differs in tumors of different types, which makes the individualization of RT as a rational but challenging goal. One contributor to tumor cell radiation survival is signaling through the Ras pathway. Three RAS genes encode 4 Ras isoforms: K-Ras4A, K-Ras4B, H-Ras, and N-Ras. RAS family members are found to be mutated in approximately 19% of human cancers. Mutations in RAS lead to constitutive activation of the gene product and activation of multiple Ras-dependent signal-transduction cascades. Preclinical studies have shown that the expression of mutant KRAS affects DDR and increases cell survival after irradiation. Approximately 70% of RAS mutations occur in KRAS. Thus, applying targeted therapies directly against K-Ras as well as K-Ras upstream activators and downstream effectors might be a tumor-specific approach to overcome K-Ras-mediated RT resistance.

Amino acids are indispensable for both cancer and immune cells. However, the clinical significance of amino acid transporting SLC members in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains unclear. This study aimed to develop an SLC family-based model to predict the prognosis and the response of STAD patients to immunotherapy. Methods: A total of 1239 tumor cases were obtained from online databases. The training set (n = 371) consisted of RNA sequencing profiles obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), while those from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used as the test set. Subsequently, the clinical characteristics and immune profiles were investigated, and potential immunotherapy response prediction values of the model were assessed. Results: Based on the TCGA cohort, an SLC family-based model was developed using multivariate Cox analysis. All tumor cases were stratified into high- and low-risk groups considering the SLC model. High-risk patients had a worse overall survival (OS) than low-risk patients, consistent with the results of GEO cohorts. Comprehensive analyses revealed that the high-risk group was correlated with aggressiveness-related pathways, whereas the low-risk group had better T helper cell infiltration and stronger immunotherapy response. Compared to the high-risk group, the low-risk group presented increased PD-L1 and tumor mutation burden.

If the goal is to minimize the number of HLA disparities, partially matched unrelated donors are more likely to share 8 or 9 of 10 HLA alleles with the recipient. However, over the last decade, there has been success with haploidentical HCT performed using the stem cells from HLA half-matched related donors. As the majority of patients have at least one eligible and motivated haploidentical donor, recruitment of haploidentical related donors is frequently more rapid than of unrelated donors. This advantage in the accessibility has historically been offset by the increased risks of graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease and delayed immune reconstitution. Various ex vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) methods have been investigated to overcome the immunological barrier and facilitate immune reconstitution after a haploidentical HCT. This review summarizes historical and contemporary clinical trials of haploidentical TCD-HCT, mainly in pediatric malignancy, and describes the evolution of these approaches with a focus on serial improvements in the kinetics of immune reconstitution.

Molecular testing may contribute to clinical decision-making by molecular risk stratification, for example predicting lymph node (LN) metastasis. Here, we build a risk stratification model based on molecular profiling of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) washout DNA (wDNA) for the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules.Fifty-eight patients were recruited, FNA wDNA samples were analyzed using CNV profiling through low-coverage whole genome sequencing (LC-WGS) and BRAF mutation was analyzed using quantitative PCR. FNA pathology was reported as a Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) score. Ultrasound examination produced a Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) score.In total, 37 (63.8%) patients with a TIRADS score of 4A, 13 (22.4%) patients with a TIRADS score of 4B, and 8 (13.8%) patients with a TIRADS score of 4C were recruited after ultrasound examination. All patients underwent FNA with wDNA profiling. CNVs were identified in 17 (29.3%) patients. CNVs were frequent in patients with a BSRTC score of V or VI, including eight (47.1%) patients with a score of VI and five (29.4%) with a score of V, but not in patients with a score of III, II, or I (0%). BRAF mutation was not significantly correlated with BSRTC score. LN metastasis was found more frequently in CNV-positive (CNV+) than in CNV-negative (CNV-) patients (85.7% vs. 34.6%, odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a011.33, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). In total, three molecular subtypes of thyroid nodules were identified in this study: 1) CNV+, 2) CNV- and BRAF positive (BRAF+), and 3) CNV- and BRAF negative (BRAF-). For the CNV+ subtype, 10 (83.3%) lesions with LN metastasis were found, including four (100%) small lesions (i.e. \u2264\u00a05\u00a0mm). For the CNV- and BRAF+ nodules, LN metastases were detected in only seven (60.0%) larger tumors (i.e. >\u00a05\u00a0mm). For CNV- and BRAF- tumors, LN metastasis was also frequently found in larger tumors only.It is feasible to identify high-risk LN metastasis thyroid cancer from FNA washout samples preoperatively using wDNA CNV profiling using LC-WGS.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": ["Humans", "Thyroid Nodule", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Thyroid Neoplasms", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Whole Genome Sequencing", "DNA"]}, "36313739": {"ArticleTitle": "Ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation: 20 years experience in Bologna University.", "ArticleAbstract": "To report the 20-year experience in ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) and ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) of the Bologna clinical center (Bologna, Italy).Retrospective cohort study.1026 pediatrics and women aged between 2 and 38 years who underwent OTC and OTT between January 2002 to January 2022.Of the 1026 patients, 238 (22.8%) were pediatrics (\u2264 17 years, Group 1) and 788 (77.2%) were adult women (range 18-38 years, Group 2).

Accumulating evidence has suggested that carcinoma cells can enter a resistant state via induction of the EMT. In this review, we discussed the underlying mechanism of PBD-induced EMT and the current understanding of its role in cancer drug resistance, with emphasis on how this novel knowledge can be exploited to overcome PBD resistance via EMT-targeted compounds, especially those under clinical trials.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36313708": {"ArticleTitle": "A novel melanoma prognostic model based on the ferroptosis-related long non-coding RNA.", "ArticleAbstract": "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death related to the biological process of many kinds of tumors. Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNA) have been found to play essential roles in the tumor, and their functions in the ferroptosis of tumor cells have been partially discovered. However, there is no summary of ferroptosis-related LncRNA and its functions in melanoma. In the present study, we aim to explore the expression profile of ferroptosis-related LncRNA genes and their value in melanoma prognosis by bioinformatics analysis. The expression of ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) from melanoma clinical data was extracted based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. By screening the RNA expression data of 472 cases of melanoma and 810 cases of normal skin, eighteen ferroptosis-related differential genes were found to be related to the overall survival rate. Furthermore, 384 ferroptosis-related LncRNAs were discovered through constructing the mRNA-LncRNA co-expression network, and ten of them were found with prognostic significance in melanoma by multivariate Cox analysis. Risk assessment showed that the high expression of LncRNA00520 is associated with poor prognosis, while the increased expression of the other LncRNA is beneficial to the prognosis of patients with melanoma. From univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, there were ten ferroptosis-related LncRNA risk models towards to be significant independent prognostic factors for patients with melanoma and valuable predictive factors for overall survival (OS)(P<0.05). The ROC curve further suggested that the risk score has relatively reliable predictive ability (AUC=0.718). The protein level of ferroptosis-related genes was verified by the HPA database and IHC test, leading to the discovery that the expressions of ALOX5, PEBP1, ACSL4, and ZEB1 proteins up-regulated in tumor tissues, and existed differences between tumor tissues and normal tissues.

Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins and histone acetyltransferases (HAT) are epigenetic regulatory proteins that create and maintain epigenetic states supporting oncogenesis. BET inhibitors and HAT inhibitors are currently being investigated as cancer therapeutics due to their ability to suppress cancer-promoting epigenetic modifiers. Due to the extensive molecular crosstalk between BET proteins and HAT proteins, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of BET and HAT could more potently inhibit CRC cells than inhibition of each individual protein.We investigated the activity and mechanisms of a dual BET and HAT inhibitor, NEO2734, in CRC cell lines and mouse xenografts. MTS, flow cytometry, and microscopy were used to assess cell viability. qPCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescent staining were used to assess mechanisms of action.We found that NEO2734 more potently suppresses CRC cell growth than first generation BET inhibitors, regardless of the status of common CRC driver mutations. We previously showed that BET inhibitors upregulate DR5 to induce extrinsic apoptosis. In the current study, we show that NEO2734 treatment induces CRC cell apoptosis via both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. NEO2734 increases p53 expression and subsequently increased expression of the p53-upregulated mediator of apoptosis (PUMA), which is a critical mechanism for activating intrinsic apoptosis. We demonstrate that inhibition of either the intrinsic or extrinsic branches of apoptosis partially rescues CRC cells from NEO2734 treatment, while the dual inhibition of both branches of apoptosis more strongly rescues CRC cells from NEO2734 treatment. Finally, we show that NEO2734 monotherapy is able to suppress tumor growth in CRC xenografts by inducing apoptosis.Our study demonstrates NEO2734 potently suppresses CRC cells in vitro and in vivo by simultaneously upregulating PUMA and DR5 to induce cell death.

One of the ways in which the body maintains homeostasis is programmed cell death, which includes apoptosis, autophagic cell death, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, NETosis, and the more recently identified process of cuprotosis. Evasion of these cell deaths is a hallmark of cancer cells, and our elucidation of the way these cells die helps us better understands the mechanisms by which cancer arises and provides us with more ways to treat it.Studies have shown that programmed cell death requires wild-type p53 protein and that mutations of TP53 can affect these modes of programmed cell death. For example, mutant p53 promotes iron-dependent cell death in ferroptosis and inhibits apoptotic and autophagic cell death. It is clear that TP53 mutations act on more than one pathway to death, and these pathways to death do not operate in isolation. They interact with each other and together determine cell death.

We found that E3s were disordered in LUAD. Among them, MARCH1 was positively correlated with most immunological characteristics, indicating that MARCH1 designed an inflamed TME in LUAD. Coincidently, LUAD with low MARCH1 expression had a poor prognosis and was not sensitive to immune checkpoint blockers. In addition, the IRS could accurately predict the prognosis.

Low-LET ionizing radiation is well known to promote tumor cell migration and invasion, nevertheless, little data provided by studies using high-LET radiation has led to ambiguous findings. What is hypothesized to be fundamental in the modulation of migration of tumor cells exposed to ionizing radiation is the influence of the microenvironment. Therefore, the properties of cells that populate the tumor stroma cannot be ignored when studying the influence of radiation on the migratory and invasive capacity of cancer cells. This is especially important in the case of pancreatic malignancies that are characterized by an abundance of stromal cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, which are known to orchestrate the cross-talk with tumor cells.The current study aims to investigate whether the presence of factors released by irradiated fibroblasts affects the migratory and invasive capacity of pancreatic cancer cells exposed to different doses of photons or C-ions.AsPC-1 and AG01522 cells were irradiated with the same dose of photons or C-ions at room temperature. Through Boyden chamber assay, we tested whether factors secreted by irradiated fibroblasts may influence tumor cell migration, while the invasiveness of AsPC-1 cells was assessed using matrigel precoated inserts in which medium collected from non-irradiated (0 Gy), photon and C-ion irradiated fibroblasts, was added.

We exploited HCT116 cancer cell line to select resistant clones to S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), an extensively studied Eg5 loop-L5 binding inhibitor. The STLC resistant clones differed in their resistance to other loop-L5 binding inhibitors but remained sensitive to the ATP class of competitive Eg5 specific inhibitors. Eg5 is still necessary for bipolar spindle formation in the resistant clones since the cells were sensitive to RNAi mediated depletion of Eg5. One clone expressing Eg5(T107N), a dominant point mutation in the P-loop of the ATP binding domain of the motor, appeared to be not only resistant but also dependent on the presence of STLC. Eg5(T107N) expression was associated also with resistance to the clinical relevant loop-L5 Eg5 inhibitors, Arry-520 and ispinesib. Ectopic expression of the Eg5(T107N) mutant in the absence of STLC was associated with strong non-exchangeable binding to microtubules causing them to bundle. Biochemical assays showed that in contrast to the wild type Eg5-STLC complex, the ATP binding site of the Eg5(T107N) is accessible for nucleotide exchange only when the inhibitor is present. We predict that resistance can be overcome by inhibitors that bind to other than the Eg5 loop-L5 binding site having different chemical scaffolds, and that allostery-dependent resistance to Eg5 inhibitors may also occur in cells and may have positive implications in chemotherapy since once diagnosed may be beneficial following cessation of the chemotherapeutic regimen.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36313675": {"ArticleTitle": "Peripheral absolute eosinophil count identifies the risk of serious immune-related adverse events in non-small cell lung cancer.", "ArticleAbstract": "Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have drawn a lot of attention lately as a result of the predominance of immunotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, the association between clinicopathological traits and the incidence of severe irAEs was investigated. To assess the prognostic impact of irAEs, survival data was analyzed.Among the 213 NSCLC patients, 122 (57.3%) had irAEs of any grade, and 38 (17.8%) had high-grade (grade 3-5) AEs. Baseline peripheral absolute eosinophil count (AEC) (HR 6.58, 95% CI: 1.5-28.8, P=0.012) was found to be an independent predictor of high-grade irAEs by multivariate analysis.

Pathophysiological changes in the gastric mucosa initiated by this bacterium can persist even after pharmacological eradication and are likely attributable also to changes induced in non-infected cells as a consequence of intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs). To better understand what such changes might entail, we isolated EVs from immortalized normal gastric GES-1 cells infected (EVHp+) or not with H. pylori (EVHp-) by ultracentrifugation and characterized them. Infection of GES-1 cells with H. pylori significantly increased the release of EVs and slightly decreased the EV mean size. Incubation with EVHp+ for 24\u00a0h decreased the viability of GES-1 cells, but increased the levels of IL-23 in GES-1 cells, as well as the migration of GES-1 and gastric cancer AGS cells. Furthermore, incubation of GES-1 and AGS cells with EVHp+, but not with EVHp-, promoted cell invasion and trans-endothelial migration in vitro. Moreover, stimulation of endothelial EA.hy926 cells for 16\u00a0h with EVHp+ promoted the formation of linked networks. Finally, analysis by mass spectrometry identified proteins uniquely present and others enriched in EVHp+ compared to EVHp-, several of which are known targets of hypoxia induced factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) that may promote the acquisition of traits important for the genesis/progression of gastric pre-neoplastic changes associated with H. pylori infection.

It is of great significance to investigate the key molecules involved in carcinogenesis from polyps to malignancies. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stably expressed in human body fluids such as plasma. Here, we demonstrated a differential expression pattern of plasma circRNAs in healthy individuals, colon polyp patients and colon cancer patients using circRNA Arraystar microarray. We explored that circRNA HADHA (circHADHA) was upregulated in plasma from polyp patients, whereas it was downregulated in plasma from colon cancer patients. Overexpression of circHADHA promoted autophagy in colon epithelial cells. Moreover, in colon cancer cells, overexpression of circHADHA promoted autophagy, whereas it inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation. CircHADHA increased the expression of ATG13 via miR-361 in both colon epithelial and cancer cells. ATG13 knockdown reduced autophagy even in the presence of circHADHA in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, the growth of circHADHA-overexpressing colon cancer cell-derived xenograft tumors was significantly decreased compared with control tumors in nude mice. In conclusion, circHADHA was differentially expressed in the plasma of healthy individuals, colon polyp patients and colon cancer patients. CircHADHA promoted autophagy by regulating ATG13 via miR-361 in both colon epithelial and cancer cells. CircHADHA suppressed tumor growth by inducing cell autophagy in colon cancer cells.

Thematic content analysis explored perceived impacts of PEWS at the level of the patient, clinician, healthcare team, and institution.PEWS improved the quality of attention for patients, reducing morbidity and mortality. Clinicians felt more knowledgeable, confident, and empowered providing patient care, resulting in greater job satisfaction. PEWS affected team dynamics by improving interdisciplinary (ward and intensive care unit) and interprofessional (physicians and nurses) relationships and communication. This ultimately led to institutional culture change with emphasis on patient safety, collaboration with other centers, and receipt of institutional awards. Together, these impacts led to hospital-wide support of ongoing PEWS use.In resource-limited hospitals, PEWS use results in multi-level positive impacts on patients, clinicians, teams, and institutions, creating a feedback loop that further supports ongoing PEWS use.

In recent years, CAFs have returned to the spotlight as researchers work to unpick the mechanisms by which they impact tumour evolution and therapy responses. However, study of CAFs has largely been restricted to a select number of common cancers, whereas research into CAF biology in bladder cancer has been relatively neglected. In this review, we explore the basics of CAF biology including the numerous potential cellular origins of CAFs, alongside mechanisms of CAF activation and their diverse functionality. We find CAFs play an important role in the progression of bladder cancer with significant implications on tumour cell signaling, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and the capacity to modify components of the immune system. In addition, we highlight some of the landmark papers describing CAF heterogeneity and find trends in the literature to suggest that the iCAF and myCAF subtypes defined in bladder cancer share common characteristics with CAF subtypes described in other settings such as breast and pancreatic cancer. Moreover, based on findings in other common cancers we identify key therapeutic challenges associated with CAFs, such as the lack of specific CAF markers, the paucity of research into bladder-specific CAFs and their relationship with therapies such as radiotherapy. Of relevance, we describe a variety of strategies used to target CAFs in several common cancers, paying particular attention to TGF\u03b2 signaling as a prominent regulator of CAF activation. In doing so, we find parallels with bladder cancer that suggest CAF targeting may advance therapeutic options in this setting and improve the current poor survival outcomes in bladder cancer which sadly remain largely unchanged over recent decades.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36313649": {"ArticleTitle": "Editorial: Strategic molecular biomarkers and microRNAs in cancer.", "ArticleAbstract": "", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36313648": {"ArticleTitle": "Stereotactic partial breast irradiation in primary breast cancer: A comprehensive review of the current status and future directions.", "ArticleAbstract": "In selected low-risk breast cancer patients, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) may represent an alternative option to the whole breast irradiation to reduce the volume of irradiated breast and total treatment duration.

For an unbiased functional analysis of all genome-encoded proteases, i.e., the degradome, in breast cancer cell growth, we applied an inducible RNA interference library for protease-focused genetic screens. Importantly, these functional screens were performed in two phenotypically different murine breast cancer cell lines, including one stem cell-like cell line that showed phenotypic plasticity under changed nutrient and oxygen availability. Our unbiased genetic screens identified 252 protease genes involved in breast cancer cell growth that were further restricted to 100 hits by a selection process. Many of those hits were supported by literature, but some proteases were novel in their functional link to breast cancer. Interestingly, we discovered that the environmental conditions influence the degree of breast cancer cell dependency on certain proteases. For example, breast cancer stem cell-like cells were less susceptible to depletion of several mitochondrial proteases in hypoxic conditions. From the 100 hits, nine proteases were functionally validated in murine breast cancer cell lines using individual knockdown constructs, highlighting the high reliability of our screens.

We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of CVD and all-cause mortality, comparing PSCC patients with general population men. A cumulative mortality curve and competitive risk regression model were utilized to evaluate the prognostic factors of CVD-specific death.Death distribution is as follows: PSCC (42.4%), other causes (21.3%) CVD (19%), and other cancers (17.3%). PSCC patients are more like to die from CVD (SMR=3.2, 95%CI: 3.1-3.3) and all-cause death compared with the general population. Meanwhile, patients undergoing surgery show a relatively higher CVD-specific mortality than the general population (SMR=2.7, 95%CI: 2.4-3.2).

GBM necrosis is typically first detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after prominent necrosis has already formed. Therefore, radiological appearances of early necrosis formation and the temporal-spatial development of necrosis alongside tumor progression remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap leads to a lack of reliable radiographic diagnostic/prognostic markers in early GBM progression to detect necrosis. Recently, we reported an orthotopic xenograft GBM murine model driven by hyperactivation of the Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) which recapitulates the extent of GBM necrosis seen among patients. In this study, we utilized this model to perform a temporal radiographic and histological study of necrosis development. We observed tumor tissue actively undergoing necrosis first appears more brightly enhancing in the early stages of progression in comparison to the rest of the tumor tissue. Later stages of tumor progression lead to loss of enhancement and unenhancing signals in the necrotic central portion of tumors on T1-weighted post-contrast MRI. This central unenhancing portion coincides with the radiographic and clinical definition of necrosis among GBM patients. Moreover, as necrosis evolves, two relatively more contrast-enhancing rims are observed in relationship to the solid enhancing tumor surrounding the central necrosis in the later stages. The outer more prominently enhancing rim at the tumor border probably represents the infiltrating tumor edge, and the inner enhancing rim at the peri-necrotic region may represent locally infiltrating immune cells. The associated inflammation at the peri-necrotic region was further confirmed by immunohistochemical study of the temporal development of tumor necrosis.

Functions such as cell proliferation and migration, both in vitro and in vivo, were inhibited by downregulation of IGF2BP3. The analysis of RNA-seq indicated that KLK5 was a downstream target of IGF2BP3. The expression of KLK5 was measured in GBC cells and tumor samples.

Despite the recent development of better diagnostic tools and therapy, the five-year survival rate for individuals with advanced and metastatic ccRCC remains dismal. Unfortunately, ccRCC is less susceptible to radiation and chemotherapy. Consequently, targeted therapy and immunotherapy play a crucial role in the treatment of ccRCC. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are noncoding RNAs transcribed by enhancers. Extensive research has shown that eRNAs are implicated in a variety of cancer signaling pathways. However, the biological functions of eRNAs have not been systematically investigated in ccRCC. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the role of eRNAs in the onset and management of ccRCC. Patient prognosis-influencing eRNAs and target genes were chosen to construct a predictive signature. On the basis of the median riskscore, ccRCC patients were split into high- and low-risk subgroups. The prediction efficiency was assessed in several cohorts, and multi-omics analysis was carried out to investigate the differences and underlying mechanisms between the high- and low-risk groups. In addition, we investigated its potential to facilitate clinical treatment choices.

We found that high FLVCR2 expression was related to infiltration degrees of immune cells and immune scores among AML cases, indicating that FLVCR2 possibly had a crucial effect on AML progression through the immune response. Specifically, FLVCR2 upregulation was negatively related to the immune infiltration degrees of activated natural killer cells, activated memory CD4+ T cells, activated dendritic cells, and CD8+ T cells using CIBERSORT analysis.

Amhr2 is expressed in the M\u00fcllerian duct mesenchyme of both male and female embryos. A \u223c147-kb BAC clone containing the Amhr2 locus was used to generate transgenic mice. The transgene was able to rescue the block in M\u00fcllerian duct regression of Amhr2-null males, suggesting that the BAC clone contains regulatory sequences active in male embryos. Osx is expressed in the developing skeleton of male and female embryos but is also an AMH-induced gene that is expressed in the M\u00fcllerian duct mesenchyme exclusively in male embryos. Osx-Cre transgenic mice were previously generated using a \u223c204-kb BAC clone.

Methods: We retrospectively collected two cervical cancer cohorts: TCGA and GSE44001. Consensus clustering approach was conducted based on expression profiling of recurrence- and immune-related genes. The abundance of immune cells was inferred via five algorithms. Immune functions and signatures were quantified through ssGSEA. Genetic mutations were analyzed by maftools package. Immunotherapeutic response was inferred via tumor mutation burden (TMB), Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE), and Submap methods. Finally, we developed a LASSO model for recurrence prediction. Results: Cervical cancer samples were categorized into two immune subtypes (IC1, and IC2). IC2 exhibited better disease free survival (DFS), increased immune cell infiltration within the immune microenvironment, higher expression of immune checkpoints, higher activity of immune-relevant pathways (APC co-inhibition and co-stimulation, inflammation-promoting, MHC class I, IFN response, leukocyte and stromal fractions, macrophage regulation, and TCR Shannon), and higher frequencies of genetic mutations.

A m7G-related gene pair signature was established using the Cox and LASSO regression analyses. A series of in silico analyses based on the signature included analysis of prognosis, correlation analysis, immune-related analysis, and estimation of tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and response to immunotherapy. A nomogram prediction model was then constructed. Results: In total, 2156 m7G-related gene pairs were screened based on 152 m7G-related genes. Then, a prognostic signature of seven gene pairs was constructed, and the patients were stratified into high- or low-risk groups. Better overall survival (OS), left-sided tumor, early stage, immune activity, and low proportion of MSI-low and MSI-high were all associated with a low risk score. High-risk patients had a higher TMB, and patients with a high TMB had a poor OS. Furthermore, the risk score was linked to immune checkpoint expression (including PD-L1), the tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score, and chemotherapy sensitivity. We also created an accurate nomogram to increase the clinical applicability of the risk score. Conclusion: We identified an m7G pair-based prognostic signature associated with prognosis, immune landscape, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in CRC. These findings could help us to better understand the role of m7G in CRC, as well as pave the path for novel methods to assess prognosis and design more effective individualized therapeutic strategies.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36313439": {"ArticleTitle": "Molecular subtypes based on cuproptosis-related genes and immune profiles in lung adenocarcinoma.", "ArticleAbstract": "Background: Recent studies have identified several molecular subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) that have different prognoses to help predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the prognostic prediction is less than satisfactory. Alterations in intracellular copper levels may affect the tumor immune microenvironment and are linked to cancer progression. Previous studies have identified some genes related to cuproptosis. The characteristics of the cuproptosis molecular subtypes have not been thoroughly studied in LUAD. Methods: The transcriptomic data and clinical information of 632 LUAD patients were used to investigate the LUAD molecular subtypes that are associated with the cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs), the tumor immune microenvironment, and stemness. The cuproptosis score was constructed using univariate Cox regression and the minor absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to quantify the prognostic characteristics. Results: Three different molecular subtypes related to cuproptosis, with different prognoses, were identified in LUAD. Cluster A had the highest cuproptosis score and the worst prognosis. Patients in the high cuproptosis score group had a higher somatic mutation frequency and stemness scores. Patients in the low cuproptosis score group had more immune infiltration and better prognosis. Conclusion: Molecular subtypes of LUAD based on CRGs reflect the differences in LUAD patients. The cuproptosis score can be used as a promising biomarker, which is of great significance to distinguish the relationship between cuproptosis and the immune microenvironment. The cuproptosis signature based on the cuproptosis score and clinical characteristics of individual patients will be useful for guiding immunotherapy in LUAD.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36313438": {"ArticleTitle": "A genomic and transcriptomic study toward breast cancer.", "ArticleAbstract": "Background: Breast carcinoma is well recognized to be having the highest global occurrence rate among all cancers, being the leading cause of cancer mortality in females. The aim of this study was to elucidate breast cancer at the genomic and transcriptomic levels in different subtypes so that we can develop more personalized treatments and precision medicine to obtain better outcomes. Method: In this study, an expression profiling dataset downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, GSE45827, was re-analyzed to compare the expression profiles of breast cancer samples in the different subtypes. Using the GEO2R tool, different expression genes were identified. Using the STRING online tool, the protein-protein interaction networks were conducted. Using the Cytoscape software, we found modules, seed genes, and hub genes and performed pathway enrichment analysis. The Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyze the overall survival. MicroRNAs and transcription factors targeted different expression genes and were predicted by the Enrichr web server. Result: The analysis of these elements implied that the carcinogenesis and development of triple-negative breast cancer were the most important and complicated in breast carcinoma, occupying the most different expression genes, modules, seed genes, hub genes, and the most complex protein-protein interaction network and signal pathway. In addition, the luminal A subtype might occur in a completely different way from the other three subtypes as the pathways enriched in the luminal A subtype did not overlap with the others. We identified 16 hub genes that were related to good prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer. Moreover, SRSF1 was negatively correlated with overall survival in the Her2 subtype, while in the luminal A subtype, it showed the opposite relationship. Also, in the luminal B subtype, CCNB1 and KIF23 were associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, new transcription factors and microRNAs were introduced to breast cancer which would shed light upon breast cancer in a new way and provide a novel therapeutic strategy. Conclusion: We preliminarily delved into the potentially comprehensive molecular mechanisms of breast cancer by creating a holistic view at the genomic and transcriptomic levels in different subtypes using computational tools.

However, the exact composition of TIICs and their prognostic values in ccRCC have not been well defined. A total of 534 ccRCC samples with survival information and TIIC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset were included in our research. The ImmuCellAI tool was employed to estimate the abundance of 24 TIICs and further survival analysis explored the prognostic values of TIICs in ccRCC. In addition, the expression levels of immunosuppressive molecules (PDL1, PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4) in the high- and low-risk groups were explored. Various subtypes of TIICs had distinct infiltrating features and most TIICs exhibited dysregulated abundance between normal and tumor tissues. Moreover, specific kinds of TIICs had encouraging prognostic values in ccRCC. Further analysis constructed a 4-TIICs signature to evaluate the prognosis of ccRCC patients. Cox regression analyses confirmed the independent prognostic role of the signature in ccRCC. Moreover, immunosuppressive molecules, including PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4, were significantly upregulated in the high-risk group and predicted poor prognosis. However, PDL1 was not changed between high- and low-risk groups and could not predict poor prognosis. To sum up, our research explored the landscape of TIICs in ccRCC and established a novel 4-TIIC prognostic signature, which could effectively predict the prognosis for patients with ccRCC.

Materials and methods: LncRNA expression profiles, containing 375 stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) samples, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The co-expression network of lncRNA and glycolysis-related genes was used to identify the glycolysis-related lncRNAs. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis were used to detect the glycolysis-related lncRNA with prognostic significance. Then, Bayesian Lasso-logistic and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to screen the glycolysis-related lncRNA with independent prognostic significance and to develop the risk model. Patients were assigned into the low- and high-risk cohorts according to their risk scores. A nomogram model was constructed based on clinical information and risk scores. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to visualize the functional and pathway enrichment analyses of the glycolysis-related lncRNA. Finally, the robustness of the results obtained was verified in an internal validation data set.

The risk score was identified as an independent prognostic factor for the patients with STAD [HR = 1.315, 95% CI (1.056-1.130), p < 0.001] via multivariate Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn and the area under curve (AUC) values of 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) were calculated to be 0.691, 0.717, and 0.723 respectively. Similar results were obtained in the validation data set. In addition, seven glycolysis-related lncRNAs were significantly enriched in the classical tumor processes and pathways including cell adhesion, positive regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and JAK_STAT signaling pathway.

This study aimed to identify the histone acetylation-related lncRNAs (HARlncRNAs) with respect to the prognosis in OC. We obtained the transcriptome data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); HARlncRNAs were first identified by co-expression and differential expression analyses, and then univariate Cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to construct the HARlncRNAs risk signature. Kaplan-Meier analysis, time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC), univariate Cox regression, multivariate Cox regression, nomogram, and calibration were conducted to verify and evaluate the risk signature. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in risk groups were conducted to explore the tightly correlated pathways with the risk group. A risk signature with 14 HARlncRNAs in OC was finally established and further validated in the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort; the 1-, 3-, and 5-year ROC value, nomogram, and calibration results confirmed the good prediction power of this model.

Results: PARP10 was found to be markedly elevated in OSCC tissues. The upregulation of PARP10 predicted shorter overall survival and disease-specific survival and was significantly correlated with several malignant features. Moreover, depletion of PARP10 markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OSCC cells, and promoted OSCC cell apoptosis, and resulted in alterations of relevant proteins. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between the expression of PARP10 and Ki67, PARP1, MMP2, and VEGF. In addition, depletion of PARP10 impaired the PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways.

However, the gene signature and prognostic value of m6A regulators and m6A-associated RNAs in regulating sarcoma (SARC) development and progression remain largely unexplored. Therefore, further research is required. Methods: We obtained expression data for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and miRNAs of SARC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. Correlation analysis and two target gene prediction databases (miRTarBase and LncBase v.2) were used to deduce m6A-related miRNAs and lncRNAs, and Cytoscape software was used to construct ceRNA-regulating networks. Based on univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses, an m6A-associated RNA risk signature (m6Ascore) model was established. Prognostic differences between subgroups were explored using Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis. Risk score-related biological phenotypes were analyzed in terms of functional enrichment, tumor immune signature, and tumor mutation signature. Finally, potential immunotherapy features and drug sensitivity predictions for this model were also discussed. Results: A total of 16 miRNAs, 104 lncRNAs, and 11 mRNAs were incorporated into the ceRNA network. The risk score was obtained based on RP11-283I3.6, hsa-miR-455-3p, and CBLL1. Patients were divided into two risk groups using the risk score, with patients in the low-risk group having longer overall survival (OS) than those in the high-risk group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated that risk characteristic performed well in predicting the prognosis of patients with SARC. In addition, lower m6Ascore was also positively correlated with the abundance of immune cells such as monocytes and mast cells activated, and several immune checkpoint genes were highly expressed in the low-m6Ascore group. According to our analysis, lower m6Ascore may lead to better immunotherapy response and OS outcomes. The risk signature was significantly associated with the chemosensitivity of SARC. Finally, a nomogram was constructed to predict the OS in patients with SARC. The concordance index (C-index) for the nomogram was 0.744 (95% CI: 0.707-0.784). The decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration plot, and ROC curve all showed that this nomogram had good predictive performance.

Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into six groups of control, \"8 Gy X-rays\", mobile phone, \"mobile phone+8 Gy\", Wi-Fi, and \"Wi-Fi+8 Gy\".

Toxicity, lack of clinical efficacy, and development of resistance phenotypes are the main challenges in the control of prostate malignancies. Notably, castration-resistance prostate cancer (CRPCa) is a highly aggressive and metastatic phenotype of the disease with a poor prognosis and very limited therapeutic options. Herein, we report the isolation and genotypic identification of a soil-derived fungus Aspergillus neoniveus using the PCR-based internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region amplification approach. HPLC/MS investigation of the metabolic profile of the ethyl acetate extract from the fungal biomass revealed tentative identification of forty-five compounds belonging to various chemical classes including \u03b3-butyrolactones, alkaloids, phenolics, and quinoids. Furthermore, the chromatographic purification of microbial extract enabled the identification of nervonic acid methyl ester (1) for the first time from endophytic fungi, as well as acetyl aszonalenin (2), and butyrolactone II (3) for the first time from A. neoniveus. The chemical frameworks of the isolated compounds were identified via extensive spectral analysis including 1 and 2D NMR and MS. The X-ray crystal structure and absolute configuration of acetyl aszonalenin (2) were also determined. Additionally, screening of in vitro anticancer activity of the fungal extract revealed its potential antiproliferative and anti-migratory activities against five different prostate cancer cells (PC3, PC-3M, DU-145, CWR-R1ca, and 22Rv1), including different cells with the castration-resistance phenotype. Moreover, the isolated metabolites significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and colonization of human prostate cancer cells at low micromolar levels, thus providing credence for future investigation of these metabolites in relevant anti-prostate cancer animal models. Furthermore, computational target prediction tools identified the cannabinoid G-protein coupled receptors type 1 (CB1) as a potential biological target mediating, at least in part, the anticancer effects of acetylaszonalenin (2). Moreover, molecular modeling and docking studies revealed a favorable binding pose at the CB1 receptor orthosteric ligand pocket aided by multiple polar and hydrophobic interactions with critical amino acids.

However, the action and pharmacological mechanism of ECD remain largely unclear. In the present study, we explored the effects and mechanisms of ECD in the treatment of CRC using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and systematic experimental validation. Methods: The active components of ECD were obtained from the TCMSP database and the potential targets of them were annotated by the STRING database. The CRC-related targets were identified from different databases (OMIM, DisGeNet, GeneCards, and DrugBank). The interactive targets of ECD and CRC were screened and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed. Then, the hub interactive targets were calculated and visualized from the PPI network using the Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. In addition, the molecular docking was performed. Finally, systematic in vitro, in vivo and molecular biology experiments were performed to further explore the anti-tumor effects and underlying mechanisms of ECD in CRC. Results: A total of 116 active components and 246 targets of ECD were predicted based on the component-target network analysis. 2406 CRC-related targets were obtained from different databases and 140 intersective targets were identified between ECD and CRC. 12 hub molecules (STAT3, JUN, MAPK3, TP53, MAPK1, RELA, FOS, ESR1, IL6, MAPK14, MYC, and CDKN1A) were finally screened from PPI network. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses demonstrated that the biological discrepancy was mainly focused on the tumorigenesis-, immune-, and mechanism-related pathways. Based on the experimental validation, ECD could suppress the proliferation of CRC cells by inhibiting cell cycle and promoting cell apoptosis. In addition, ECD could inhibit tumor growth in mice. Finally, the results of molecular biology experiments suggested ECD could regulate the transcriptional levels of several hub molecules during the development of CRC, including MAPKs, PPARs, TP53, and STATs.

The growth of uterine leiomyoma is mediated by various steroids and growth factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of various growth factors in uterine leiomyoma. Additionally, comparing the effects of existing medication and specific growth factor inhibitors on leiomyoma and the normal myometrium, we aimed to see the potential of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors as therapeutic drugs for uterine leiomyoma. Methods: This in vitro study included uterine leiomyoma samples from 12 patients who underwent hysterectomy by laparoscopy or laparotomy at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital between May 2016 and March 2018. Normal myometrium and uterine leiomyoma tissue were obtained from each patient and the expression of growth factors was compared using immunohistochemical staining. After the primary culture of normal myometrial and leiomyoma cells, cell viability was evaluated following treatment with 100 nM ulipristal acetate (UPA) and mifepristone for 48 h. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the protein expression of each growth factor. Cell viability was determined following treatment with a 10-\u00b5M TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (LY364947) and a 5-\u00b5M VEGF inhibitor (axitinib) for 24 h in cultured normal myometrium and leiomyoma cells. Results: Immunohistochemical staining revealed the significantly higher intensity of TGF-\u03b2 and VEGF in the leiomyoma tissue than in the normal myometrium (P < 0.05). Mifepristone treatment decreased VEGF expression by 62% in the leiomyoma cells (P < 0.05). According to the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, cell viability was decreased after UPA, mifepristone, TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor, and VEGF inhibitor treatments in the normal myometrium and leiomyoma tissue. The effects of the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor significantly differed between normal myometrium and leiomyoma tissue, with a greater decrease in cell survival in the leiomyoma tissue (P < 0.05). Post-hoc analysis showed that the TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF inhibitors had a greater inhibitory effect on leiomyoma tissue compared with that of UPA. Conclusion: TGF-\u03b2 and VEGF inhibitors significantly decreased the viability of uterine leiomyoma cells, showing stronger effects than the conventional drug, UPA.

In addition, basal-squamous BCa is enriched for SqD, and these tumors have a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is critical to elucidate the mechanisms to drive the basal-squamous phenotype of human BCa.

A single RBP can bind to and regulate the expression of many RNA molecules via a variety of mechanisms, including translational suppression, prevention of RNA degradation, and alteration in subcellular localization. To elucidate the role of a specific RBP within a given cellular context, it is essential to first identify the group of RNA molecules to which it binds. This has traditionally been achieved using cross-linking-based assays in which cells are first exposed to agents that cross-link RBPs to nucleic acids and then lysed to extract and purify the RBP-nucleic acid complexes. The nucleic acids within the mixture are then released and analyzed via conventional means (e.g., microarray analysis, qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, or Northern blot). While cross-linking-based ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) has proven its utility within some contexts, it is technically challenging, inefficient, and suboptimal given the amount of time and resources (e.g., cells and antibodies) required. Additionally, these types of studies often require the use of over-expressed versions of proteins, which can introduce artifacts. Here, we describe a streamlined version of RIP that utilizes exclusion-based purification technologies. This approach requires significantly less starting material and resources compared to traditional RIP approaches, takes less time, which is tantamount given the labile nature of RNA, and can be used with endogenously expressed proteins.

Based on the evidence that metastasis proceeds through utilizing the molecular mechanisms of gastrulation, we hypothesized that chemicals interrupting zebrafish gastrulation might suppress the metastasis of cancer cells. Thus, we developed a phenotype-based chemical screen that uses epiboly, the first morphogenetic movement in gastrulation, as a marker. The screen only needs zebrafish embryos and enables hundreds of chemicals to be tested in five hours by observing the epiboly progression of chemical-treated embryos. In the screen, embryos at the two-cell stage are firstly corrected and then developed to the sphere stage. The embryos are treated with a test chemical and incubated in the presence of the chemical until vehicle-treated embryos develop to the 90% epiboly stage. Finally, positive 'hit' chemicals that interrupt epiboly progression are selected by comparing epiboly progression of the chemical-treated and vehicle-treated embryos under a stereoscopic microscope. A previous study subjected 1,280 FDA-approved drugs to the screen and identified adrenosterone and pizotifen as epiboly-interrupting drugs.

Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is a critical factor influencing the composition of breast milk. Thus, in mothers with obesity, miRNAs in bEVs can be altered, which might be associated with adverse health outcomes in infants. In this study, we examined 798 miRNAs to determine which miRNAs are altered in the bEVs of mothers with obesity and their potential impact on breastfed infants.We recruited healthy nursing mothers who were either of normal weight (BMI < 25) or with obesity (BMI \u2265 30) based on their pre-pregnancy BMI, and delivered a singleton baby in the prior 6 months. EVs were isolated from breast milk with ultracentrifugation. bEV characteristics were examined by flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging of EV markers. A total of 798 miRNAs were screened using a NanoString human miRNA panel to find differentially expressed miRNAs in bEVs of mothers with obesity compared to mothers of normal weight.We included 65 nursing mothers: 47 of normal weight and 18 with obesity based on pre-pregnancy BMI. After bEV isolation, we confirmed the expression of various EV markers. Out of 37 EV markers, CD326 (EpCaM) was the most highly expressed in bEVs. The most abundant miRNAs in bEVs include miR-30b-5p, miR-4454, miR-494-3p, and let-7 miRNAs.

Immunotherapy against the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) /programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1), one of the most popular auxiliary treatments in recent years, has been applied in various tumor treatments, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, inevitable issues such as side effects and drug resistance emerge following the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may participate in the regulation of PD-L1 expression. Abnormal PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation results in increased PD-L1 protein translation, whereas PD-L1 overexpression can activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inversely. Via downstream proteins, including 4E-BP1, STAT3, NF-\u03baB, c-MYC, and AMPK in aberrant energy status, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can regulate PD-L1 post-transcription and translation. Besides, the regulation of the PI3K pathway by the PD-1/PD-L1 axis involves both tumor cells and the tumor immune microenvironment. Inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 have been successfully applied in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer and breast cancer. Meanwhile, drug resistance from alternative pathway activation also evidently affects clinical progress.

The aim of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of using cfDNA as a liquid biopsy for the early detection of CRC. For this purpose, we implemented an azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate-induced murine carcinogenesis model to detect oncogenic somatic mutations in Ctnnb1 and Kras during CRC development. To enhance the sensitivity in the detection, E-ice-COLD-PCR was utilized to selectively enrich for mutant alleles, followed by massively parallel sequencing.

The concentration of cfDNA was increased along the carcinogenic process. Polyclonality in Ctnnb1 was found in tumor samples and cfDNA in this model. On the other hand, the use of cfDNA as a non-invasive test resulted in superior early detection compared to microPET/CT imaging.

Calculated standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes of death at different follow-up times and performed subgroup analyses. Results: In total, 63,560 patients with EC were retrieved from the public database. And 52,503 died during the follow-up period. Most deaths were due to EC itself within 5 years after diagnosis, but over 10 years, 59% EC patients died from noncancer causes. Cardiovascular disease was the major noncancer cause of death in patients with EC, accounting for 43%. Suicide and self-injury (2%) of EC patients should not be ignored.

The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of regorafenib in real-world practice, with the secondary objective to investigate its effectiveness, including its overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: In total, 301 patients were included in the analysis (254 patients with CRC, 14 patients with GIST, and 33 patients with HCC). The incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) were 85.0%, 78.6%, and 81.8% in patients with CRC, GIST, and HCC, respectively. The most frequent AE related to regorafenib in the three cancer types was palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). The ORRs of patients with CRC, GIST, and HCC were 4.7%, 0%, and 41.4%, respectively. The median PFS and OS were 2.1 and 6.1 months for CRC, respectively; 9.2 and 16.4 months for GIST, respectively; and 5.5 months and not estimated (NE) for HCC, respectively. Patients who experienced a dose modification or discontinuation of regorafenib showed significantly shorter median PFS and OS (2.2 vs. 2.6 months, respectively, P = 0.0335 for PFS; 5.3 vs. 8.5 months, respectively, P = 0.0010 for OS).

However, the pMMR group was dominated by Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Serratia, Cupriavidus and Sphingobium at the genus level. Moreover, a wide variety of microbiota associated functional pathways were observed with different MMR status. KEGG pathway analysis indicated a higher abundance of the biosynthesis and metabolic pathways of glycan and nucleotide, cell growth and death pathways, genetic replication and repair pathways in dMMR samples compared with the pMMR group.

There is an urgent need to find safe and effective treatments to reduce IR-induced intestinal injury. In this study, we reported that metformin protected mice from abdominal IR-induced intestinal injury by improving the composition and diversity of intestinal flora. The elimination of intestinal microbiota (Abx) abrogated the protective effects of metformin on irradiated mice. We further characterized that treatment of metformin increased the murine intestinal abundance of Lactobacillus, which mediated the radioprotective effect. The administration of Lactobacillus or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) into Abx mice considerably lessened IR-induced intestinal damage and restored the radioprotective function of metformin in Abx mice. In addition, applying the murine intestinal organoid model, we demonstrated that IR inhibited the formation of intestinal organoids, and metformin alone bore no protective effect on organoids after IR. However, a combination of metformin and Lactobacillus or Lactobacillus alone displayed a strong radioprotection on the organoid formation. We demonstrated that metformin/Lactobacillus activated the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling in intestinal epithelial cells and hence upregulated tight junction proteins and mucins in intestinal epithelia, increased the number of goblet cells, and augmented the mucus layer thickness to maintain the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier, which eventually contributed to reduced radiation intestinal injury. In addition, we found that Lactobacillus abundance was significantly increased in the intestine of patients receiving metformin while undergoing abdominal radiotherapy and the abundance was negatively correlated with the diarrhea duration of patients.

Here, we investigated the impact of Akkermansia muciniphila-mediated post-antibiotic gut microbial reconstitution on the development of colitis-associated CRC (CAC). The results showed that post-antibiotic replenishment of A. muciniphila worsened the tumorigenesis of CAC as indicated by increased number of large (>2 mm in diameter) tumors and both average and total tumor diameters. Measures of intestinal barrier function showed that post-antibiotic A. muciniphila gavage damaged the intestinal barrier as reflected by lower transcriptional levels of Tjp1, Ocln, Cdh1, and MUC2. Impaired gut barrier was followed by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) translocation as indicated by higher level of serum LPS-binding protein (LBP). The increased colonic mRNA levels of Il1b, Il6, and Tnfa and serum levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 indicated that post-antibiotic A. muciniphila replenishment resulted in overactivated inflammatory environment in CAC. The analysis of the evolution of the microbial community during the progression of CAC showed that post-antibiotic supplementation of A. muciniphila led to a distinct microbial configuration when compared with other treatments characterized by enriched Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, and depleted Bacteroidetes, which was accompanied by higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. Furthermore, post-antibiotic A. muciniphila administration changed the bile acid (BA) metabolic profile as indicated by decreased concentrations of secondary BA (SBA), \u03c9-murocholic acid (\u03c9MCA), and murocholic acid (muroCA). In addition, the A. muciniphila supplementation after antibiotic pretreatment also impacted the metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as evidenced by increased concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid. Our study surprisingly observed that A. muciniphila-mediated post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut microbiota aggravated the CAC in mice. It might exert its effect by damaging the gut barrier, exacerbating inflammatory responses, disrupting the post-antibiotic recovery of the microbial community, and further influencing the metabolism of BA and SCFAs.

Oncolytic viruses (OV) are emerging as contenders for the role of the synergistic agent of choice due to their multi-mechanistic effect on activating the tumor 'cold' immune microenvironment. Herpes simplex virus 1, a naturally selective OV, is the most advanced virotherapeutic compound in clinical applications for use in combination with ICI. We here present the case of a 72\u2009year-old patient with a heavily pre-treated, advanced maxillary sinus squamous cell cancer with distant metastases who developed complete response (CR) with only three administrations of a programmed death 1 inhibitor after treatment interference by a severe herpes zoster infection, based on the related alpha-herpesvirus varicella zoster virus (VZV). This exceptional response has been followed and confirmed with imaging studies over more than 5\u2009years.

In this case, it is conceivable that the interference of the infection with VZV, soon after the start of immunotherapy with ICI, led to a lasting antitumor immunity and sustained CR.

Phosphorylation of eNOS plays an important role in the synthesis of nitric oxide in endothelial cells, which is closely related to erectile dysfunction, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and other diseases. Our study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of Icariside II on the rapid phosphorylation of eNOS. In this study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with Icariside II in the presence or absence of multiple inhibitors (1\u00a0\u00b5M), including LY294002 (PI3K-inhibitor), MK-2206 (AKT-inhibitor), Bisindolylmaleimide X (AMPK-inhibitor), H-89 (CaMKII-inhibitor), KN-62 (PKA-inhibitor), Dorsomorphin (PKC-inhibitor). The proliferation of HUVECs was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). The release of nitric oxide (NO) within HUVECs was detected via fluorescence probe (DAF-FM). Western blot was used to examine the effect of Icariside II on the expression of eNOS, phosphorylation of eNOS, and common signaling pathways proteins. In this study, Icariside II was found to promote the cell proliferation and rapid NO release in HUVECs. The phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1177 was significantly increased after Icariside II stimulation and reached a peak at 10 min (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of eNOS-Thr495 was significantly decreased after 45 min of stimulation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

In the multivariate regression model that contains the parameters mentioned above, psychiatric treatment history (odds ratio (OR): 2.758, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.034-7.356, p = 0.043), low-income status (OR: 3.503, 95% CI: 1.336-9.182, p = 0.011), and alexithymia (OR: 3.482, 95% CI: 1.229-9.867, p = 0.019) were independent predictive factors for a high BDI. Conclusion Alexithymia and low PSS are significantly common in patients with prominent depressive symptoms in early-stage BC patients. Alexithymia may be associated with depression and may also have a role in depression pathogenesis in early-stage BC patients.

The primary source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure. Recently, an increase in the intake of vitamin D supplements has been noticed. The protective value of vitamin D is well established and has been studied several times for the health of the bones, cartilage, growth, various dermatological diseases, and also as a chemoprotective agent against several cancers. On the scientific front, it has yet to be established that increasing serum vitamin D levels increase the incidence of BCC. We included reports that investigated this relationship in this review. We applied keywords in published papers in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to find relevant studies. After applying the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist and the quality appraisal for 68 records, we included only ten studies. In these studies, serum levels of vitamin D were measured. Five of them supported the link between BCC incidence and development and high serum vitamin D levels (e.g., Mahamat-Saleh Y, et al.), while the other five did not (e.g., Tang JY, et al.). We included only two studies that investigated the vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism. Experts debate adding a high dose of vitamin D supplements to our daily routine. After studying most of the reports, it was ascertained that the literature supports keeping vitamin D serum levels below 30-60 nmol/L.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to compare the factors affecting the survival and prognosis of early and advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. The Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to reveal the survival difference between early and advanced GSRC and different differentiated types of gastric adenocarcinoma. The prognosis model of advanced GSRC was established with R software, and the area under curve (AUC) and C-index were used to assess the accuracy of the model.Analysis of pathological features revealed that signet ring-cell carcinoma (SRC) was more frequently seen in younger (< 60 years), female, and White patients compared to non-SRC patients. SRC was less commonly associated with early gastric cancer (EGC) (23.60% vs 39.10%), lower N0 (38.61% vs 61.03%), and larger tumour sizes > 5 cm (31.15% vs 27.10%) compared to the differentiated type, while the opposite was true compared to the undifferentiated type. Survival prognostic analysis found no significant difference in the prognosis of SRC patients among EGC patients. In contrast, among advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, the prognosis of SRC patients was correlated with age, race, tumour size, AJCC stage, T-stage, and postoperative adjuvant therapy. The predictive model showed that the 3-year AUC was 0.787, 5-year AUC was 0.806, and C-index was 0.766. Compared to non-SRC patients, patients with SRC had a better prognosis in EGC [hazard ratio (HR): 0.626, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.427-0.919, P < 0.05] and a worse prognosis in AGC (HR: 1.139, 95%CI: 1.030-1.258, P < 0.05).

It has been well documented that NNMT is elevated in multiple cancers and promotes tumor aggressiveness. In the present study, we investigated the effects of NNMT overexpression on cellular metabolism and proinflammatory responses. We found that NNMT overexpression reduced NAD+ and SAM levels, and activated the STAT3 signaling pathway. Consequently, STAT3 activation upregulated interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL1\u03b2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), leading to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) accumulation.

Although it is highly heterogeneous at genetic levels, BBS10 is one of the major causative genes worldwide. The BBS10 protein is part of a multiprotein complex localized at the basal body of the primary cilium. With the advancement of sequencing technologies, novel missense mutations are regularly reported in BBS10. However, prioritizing missense variants and conducting further in-depth analysis are key challenges in addressing their pathogenic effect. This study aims to characterize the known missense mutations of BBS10 by combining nine different in silico tools (SIFT, SNAP2, PROVEAN, Align-GVGD, ConSurf, I Mutant, MuPro, PremPS, and Dynamut) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A total of 101 BBS10 missense variants have been analyzed. Our results showed that six BBS10 missense variants (Ser191Leu, Cys19Gly, Ile342Thr, Cys371Ser, Ala417Glu, and Tyr613Cys) were potentially deleterious.

However, specialized equipment used in clinical laboratories often comes with trade-offs between operation and function serving a single role for very specific needs. For example, to achieve high analytical sensitivity and specificity, instruments such as high-performance liquid chromatography and/or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry use a complex instrument design and require thorough training of the users. On the other hand, simple tests such as protein detection in urinary tract infection using dip-stick assays provide very quick results but suffer from poor analytical sensitivity. Here, we present an application study for the 3D particle counter technology, which is based on optical confocal detection in order to scan large sample volumes (0.5-3 mL) in glass cuvettes, that aims to close the gap between analytical sensitivity and turnover assay time and simplify protein detection by adopting bead-based immunoassays. Combining the 3D particle counter technology with bead-based immunoassays, a subpicomolar limit of detection-ranging from 119 to 346 fM-was achieved within 3.5-hour assay time for recombinant mouse interleukin 6 detection.

Even though SPIONs have excellent properties regarding their biocompatibility and unique magnetic properties, they lack stability in biological fluids. To stabilize and increase the specificity of the SPIONs to target desirable cells or tissues, several surface coatings have been introduced. These surface coatings can lead to different preferences of serum protein bindings, which ultimately determine their behaviors in vitro and in vivo. Thus, understanding the interaction of SPIONs with biological systems is important for their biocompatible design and clinical applications. In this study, using proteomic analyses, we analyzed the protein corona fingerprints on SPIONs with two different coatings, including citrate and riboflavin, that have been widely used as surface coatings and ligands for enhancing cellular uptake in breast cancer cells. Though both citrate-coated SPIONs (C-SPIONs) and riboflavin-coated SPIONs (Rf-SPIONs) showed similar sizes and zeta potentials, we found that Rf-SPIONs adsorbed more serum proteins than bare SPIONs (B-SPIONs) or C-SPIONs, which was likely due to the higher hydrophobicity of the riboflavin. The enriched proteins consisted mainly of immune-responsive and blood coagulation proteins with different fingerprint profiles. Cellular uptake studies in MCF-7 breast cancer cells comparing the activities of preformed and in situ coronas showed different uptake behaviors, suggesting the role of protein corona formation in promoting the interaction between the SPIONs and the cells. The results obtained here provide the essential information for further development of the potential strategy to reduce or stimulate immune response in vivo to increase therapeutic applications of both C-SPIONs and Rf-SPIONs.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36312283": {"ArticleTitle": "Cardiovascular toxicity associated with angiogenesis inhibitors: A comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database from 2014 to 2021.", "ArticleAbstract": "The profiles of cardiovascular toxicity associated with angiogenesis inhibitors, including intravenous monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) remain poorly elucidated in real-world settings.

Overall diet quality was assessed using a diet quality index. Intake of key food groups and beverages associated with overall diet quality were investigated separately. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models adjusting for confounders.A high diet quality with high intake of fruit and vegetables, fish and shellfish and low intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat compared to a low diet quality was associated with lower risk of aIS (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.69-0.97; p = 0.015).

The tumor immune cell infiltration (ICI) is closely associated with clinical outcome with LUAD patients. The present study was designed to construct a gene signature based on the ICI of LUAD to predict prognosis.Downloaded the raw data of three cohorts of the TCGA-LUAD, GSE72094, and GSE68465 and treat them as training cohort, validation cohort one, and validation cohort two for this research. Unsupervised clustering detailed grouped LUAD cases of the training cohort based on the ICI profile. The univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier was adopted to identify potential prognostic genes from the differentially expressed genes recognized from the ICI clusters. A risk score-based prognostic signature was subsequently developed using LASSO-penalized Cox regression analysis. The Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox analysis, ROC, IAUC, and IBS were constructed to assess the ability to predict the prognosis and effects of clinical variables in another two independent validation cohorts. More innovatively, we searched similar papers in the most recent year and made comprehensive comparisons with ours. GSEA was used to discover the related signaling pathway. The immune relevant signature correlation identification and immune infiltrating analysis were used to evaluate the potential role of the signature for immunotherapy and recognize the critical immune cell that can influence the signature's prognosis capability.A signature composed of thirteen gene including ABCC2, CCR2, CERS4, CMAHP, DENND1C, ECT2, FKBP4, GJB3, GNG7, KRT6A, PCDH7, PLK1, and VEGFC, was identified as significantly associated with the prognosis in LUAD patients. The thirteen-gene signature exhibited independence in evaluating the prognosis of LUAD patients in our training and validation cohorts. Compared to our predecessors, our model has an advantage in predictive power. Nine well know immunotherapy targets, including TBX2, TNF, CTLA4, HAVCR2, GZMB, CD8A, PRF1, GZMA, and PDCD1 were recognized correlating with our signature. The mast cells were found to play vital parts in backing on the thirteen-gene signature's outcome predictive capacity.Collectively, the current study indicated a robust thirteen-gene signature that can accurately predict LUAD prognosis, which is superior to our predecessors in predictive ability.

In cancer, this compartment is critical not only for defining tumor biology but also serves as a rich source of potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Recently, we profiled the surfaceome of the blood cancer multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell malignancy. While available small molecule agents can drive initial remissions in myeloma, resistance inevitably occurs. Several new classes of immunotherapies targeting myeloma surface antigens, including antibody therapeutics and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, can further prolong survival. However, new approaches are still needed for those who relapse. We thus applied the glycoprotein cell surface capture (CSC) methodology to panel of multiple myeloma cell lines, identifying key surface protein features of malignant plasma cells. We characterized the most abundant surface proteins on plasma cells, nominating CD48 as a high-density antigen favorable for a possible avidity-based strategy to enhance CAR-T efficacy. After chronic resistance to proteasome inhibitors, a first-line therapy, we found significant alterations in the surface profile of myeloma cells, including down-regulation of CD50, CD361/EVI2B, and CD53, while resistance to another first-line therapy, lenalidomide, drove increases in CD33 and CD45/PTPRC. In contrast, short-term treatment with lenalidomide led to upregulation of the surface antigen MUC-1, thereby enhancing efficacy of MUC-1 targeting CAR-T cells. Integrating our proteomics data with available transcriptome datasets, we developed a scoring system to rank potential standalone immunotherapy targets. Novel targets of interest included CCR10, TXNDC11, and LILRB4. We developed proof-of-principle CAR-T cells versus CCR10 using its natural ligand, CCL27, as an antigen recognition domain. Finally, we developed a \"miniaturized\" version of the CSC methodology and applied it to primary myeloma patient specimens. Overall, our work creates a unique resource for the myeloma community. This study also supports unbiased surface proteomic profiling as a fruitful strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets and markers of drug resistance, that could have utility in improving myeloma patient outcomes.

Due to the tumor heterogeneity, immune system evasion and the complex interaction between the tumor microenvironment and immune cells, the great majority of malignancies need multimodal therapy. Unfortunately, tumors frequently develop treatment resistance, so it is important to have a variety of therapeutic choices available for the treatment of neoplastic diseases. Immunotherapy has lately shown clinical responses in malignancies with unfavorable outcomes. Oncolytic virus (OV) immunotherapy is a cancer treatment strategy that employs naturally occurring or genetically-modified viruses that multiply preferentially within cancer cells. OVs have the ability to not only induce oncolysis but also activate cells of the immune system, which in turn activates innate and adaptive anticancer responses. Despite the fact that OVs were translated into clinical trials, with T-VECs receiving FDA approval for melanoma, their use in fighting cancer faced some challenges, including off-target side effects, immune system clearance, non-specific uptake, and intratumoral spread of OVs in solid tumors. Although various strategies have been used to overcome the challenges, these strategies have not provided promising outcomes in monotherapy with OVs. In this situation, it is increasingly common to use rational combinations of immunotherapies to improve patient benefit. With the development of other aspects of cancer immunotherapy strategies, combinational therapy has been proposed to improve the anti-tumor activities of OVs. In this regard, OVs were combined with other biotherapeutic platforms, including various forms of antibodies, nanobodies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and dendritic cells, to reduce the side effects of OVs and enhance their efficacy.

Nevertheless, the crucial functions of ECM-related genes (ECMGs) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) have not been systematically evaluated. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of the ECMGs is required in pan-cancer, especially in PAAD. First, a pan-cancer overview of ECMGs was explored through the integration of expression profiles, prognostic values, mutation information, methylation levels, and pathway-regulation relationships. Seven ECMGs (i.e. LAMB3, LAMA3, ITGB6, ITGB4, ITGA2, LAMC2, and COL11A1) were identified to be hub genes of PAAD, which were obviously up-regulated in PAAD and considerably linked to tumor stage as well as prognosis. Subsequently, patients with PAAD were divided into 3 clusters premised on ECMG expression and ECM scores. Cluster 2 was the subtype with the best prognosis accompanied by the lowest ECM scores, further verifying ECM's significant contribution to the pathophysiological processes of PAAD. Significant differences were observed for oncogene and tumor suppressor gene expression, immune microenvironment, and chemotherapy sensitivity across three ECM subtypes. After applying a variety of bioinformatics methods, a novel and robust ECM-associated mRNA-lncRNA-based prognostic panel (ECM-APP) was developed and validated for accurately predicting clinical outcomes of patients with PAAD. Patients with PAAD were randomly categorized into the train, internal validation, and external validation cohorts; meanwhile, each patient was allocated into high-risk (unfavorable prognosis) and low-risk (favorable prognosis) populations premised on the expression traits of ECM-related mRNAs and lncRNAs. The discrepancy in the tumor mutation burden and immune microenvironment might be responsible for the difference in prognoses across the high-risk and low-risk populations.

This was shown to be independent of IRF1, IRF3, or p65, canonical transcription factors necessary for activation of both type I and III interferon promoters.

For this purpose, immune cells require well-developed mechanisms of energy generation. However, the immune system itself can also cause diseases when defective regulation results in the emergence of autoreactive lymphocytes. Recent studies provide insights into how differential patterns of immune cell responses are associated with selective metabolic pathways. This review will examine the changing metabolic requirements of Th17 cells and of B cells at different stages of their development and activation. Both cells provide protection but can also mediate diseases through the production of autoantibodies and the production of proinflammatory mediators. In health, B cells produce antibodies and cytokines and present antigens to T cells to mount specific immunity. Th17 cells, on the other hand, provide protection against extra cellular pathogens at mucosal surfaces but can also drive chronic inflammation. The latter cells can also promote the differentiation of B cells to plasma cells to produce more autoantibodies. Metabolism-regulated checkpoints at different stages of their development ensure the that self-reactive B cells clones and needless production of interleukin (IL-)17 are limited. The metabolic regulation of the two cell types has some similarities, e.g. the utility of hypoxia induced factor (HIF)1\u03b1 during low oxygen tension, to prevent autoimmunity and regulate inflammation. There are also clear differences, as Th17 cells only are vulnerable to the lack of certain amino acids. B cells, unlike Th17 cells, are also dependent of mechanistic target of rapamycin 2 (mTORC2) to function. Significant knowledge has recently been gained, particularly on Th17 cells, on how metabolism regulates these cells through influencing their epigenome. Metabolic dysregulation of Th17 cells and B cells can lead to chronic inflammation. Disease associated alterations in the genome can, in addition, cause dysregulation to metabolism and, thereby, result in epigenetic alterations in these cells.

Recently, a study showed that an itaconate derivative inhibits neuroinflammation and reduces chronic pain in mice. However, the function and molecular mechanisms of endogenous itaconate in neuropathic pain have not been fullyelucidated. In this study, the content of itaconate in the ipsilateral spinal cord after nerve-injured mice was detected with mass spectrometry. The Irg1 mouse was constructed to determine the role of endogenous itaconate in the chronic constriction nerve injury (CCI) model. The analgesic effect of exogenous itaconate was assessed with intraperitoneal and intrathecal administration in both male and female CCI mice. The spinal application of 4-OI also reduced the evoked responses of wide dynamic range neurons in CCI mice. The potential analgesic mechanism of itaconate was explored through molecular biology experiments and verified in Interleukin (IL)-10 mice. We found the levels of itaconate and IRG1 in the spinal cord significantly increased after CCI. Irg1 deficiency aggravated the mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, while the exogenous administration of the itaconate derivative 4-OI alleviated the neuropathic pain in male and female CCI mice.

To date, surgery is the main treatment option, often combined with other (neo)adjuvant therapeutic modalities to treat this malignancy and prevent relapse. Despite the invasive aspects of the majority of these therapeutic interventions and their associated side-effects, these treatments are still unable to effectively cure this disease and prevent relapse. Thus, there is an urgent need for the identification of more relevant biomarkers for more effective theranostics. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7) is a glycosylated cell surface protein that plays a critical role in immune cell functions under both healthy conditions and in cancer. It is specifically targeted by elotuzumab for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The present retrospective study aimed to investigate the expression patterns of SLAMF7 and evaluate its associations with clinicopathological features, including the survival outcomes of patients with BC. The protein expression of SLAMF7 in BC was investigated in 278 lymph node-positive formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed a significant association between cytoplasmic SLAMF7 protein expression and several clinicopathological parameters, particularly age at diagnosis (P<0.007), tumor invasion (P<0.008) and vascular invasion (P=0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the overexpression of SLAMF7 was a strong positive prognosticator of both disease-free and disease-specific survival in the patients with BC (log-rank P=0.001 and P=0.008, respectively). This suggests that patients with SLAMF7 protein expression have a higher survival rate and a lower recurrence rate. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that a weak or no SLAMF7 expression was a powerful prognosticator of poor survival outcomes associated with both tumor and vascular invasion.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these clinically distinct disorders are pathologically excessive telomere erosion, limiting cell proliferation and differentiation, tissue regeneration, and increasing genomic instability. Recent findings also indicate that telomere shortening imbalances stem cell fate and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response and the senescent-associated secretory phenotype. Bone marrow failure is the most common phenotype in patients with telomere diseases. Pulmonary fibrosis is a typical phenotype in older patients, and disease progression appears faster than in pulmonary fibrosis not associated with telomeropathies. Liver cirrhosis may present in isolation or in combination with other phenotypes. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and may be confirmed by telomere length measurement and genetic testing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have improved genetic testing; today, at least 16 genes have been implicated in telomeropathies. NGS also allows tracking of clonal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation.

The operator completed each task three times. Except for basic task 1, all tasks were remotely guided by a more experienced surgeon using 5G technology. Tasks completion time and a 30-point objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) score were utilized to assess the results of simulation training. All remote guidance processes were successfully completed without significant network latency. Through basic task 1, the operator quickly became familiar with the trained laparoscopic instruments. For basic task 2, OSATS scores increased from 16 to 24 points, and completion time decreased from 1500 to 986\u00a0s after training under 5G-assisted remote guidance. For model tasks, OSATS scores increased from 15 to 26 points, and completion time decreased from 1734 to 1142\u00a0s.

An alternative or complementation to existing prognosis modalities is the use of phytochemicals such as silibinin, which targets essential cytokines, angiogenic factors and transcription factors for a profound anti-tumor effect. However, the problems of low solubility in an aqueous physiological environment, poor penetration, high metabolism and rapid systemic clearance limit the therapeutic use of silibinin. Conjugation of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with silibinin may overcome the above challenges along with distinct advantages of biocompatibility, optical properties for monitoring and causation of cytotoxicity in cancer cells. The current study thus aims to develop silibinin conjugated gold nanoparticles (Sb-GNPs) with pH responsive release in the cancer microenvironment, optimizing several parameters for its higher activity and further evaluate the nanoplatform for their efficacy in inducing cell death in vitro against A549 lung cancer cells. GNPs was synthesized using trisodium citrate dihydrate as the reducing agent and further used for the conjugation of silibinin. The synthesized GNPs were found to be monodispersed and spherical in shape. The silibinin was successfully conjugated with gold nanoparticles and long-term stability of GNPs and Sb-GNPs nanoconjugates in suspension phase was confirmed by FTIR and DLS. Anticancer properties of Sb-GNPs were confirmed by different assay using MTT, Trypan blue dye exclusion assay and cell cycle analysis assay.

Silymarin exerts a chemopreventive effect on reactivating cell death pathways by modulation of the antiapoptotic proteins and synergizing with agonists of death domain receptors. Based on the results of these patents, silymarin could be beneficial to oncology patients, especially for the treatment of the side effects of anticancer chemotherapeutics. Following the human propensity to use phytocompounds rather than medicines based on chemical constituents, special attention must be paid to tie the value of milk thistle and silymarin from basic science to clinical applications.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36311189": {"ArticleTitle": "Effects of crocin on T-bet/GATA-3 ratio, and miR-146a and miR-106a expression levels in lung tissue of ovalbumin-sensitized mice.", "ArticleAbstract": "Although various studies have revealed the beneficial effects of crocin (derived from saffron), such as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and immune modulator, however, its exact mechanism is unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of crocin on the expression ratio of T-bet/GATA-3 as an indicator of altered immune responses in the lung tissue of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice. In addition, the effect of crocin on the expression level of miR-146a and miR-106a in the lung tissue OVA-sensitized mice was investigated.Mice were randomly divided into five groups (n=6): Control; OVA, OVA + Crocin 25, OVA + Cro 50, and OVA + Cro100 groups. Crocin was administrated intraperitoneally at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg for five consecutive days. One day after asthma induction, animals were euthanized, and lungs were sampled for pathological and gene expression analysis.OVA-sensitization led to increased inflammation and histopathological changes in the lung tissue of mice. In addition, GATA-3 expression increased (P<0.001) and T-bet expression decreased (P<0.001) in OVA-sensitized groups. The T-bet/GATA3 ratio was also reduced markedly in asthma groups (P<0.001). Furthermore, increased expression of miR-146a and miR-106a levels was evident in the lung tissue of OVA-sensitized mice (P<0.001 for both). Intervention with high concentrations of crocin (50 and 100 mg/kg) significantly reduced airway inflammation, GATA-3 expression, miR-146a expression, and miR-106a expression and corrected the T-bet/GATA-3 ratio (P<0.05 to P<0.001).Treatment with crocin led to a decrease in the severity of lung inflammation in OVA-sensitized mice, which is probably through the reduction of the T-bet/GATA-3 ratio, and mir-146a and mir-106a expression level.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36311172": {"ArticleTitle": "Pan-cancer analysis revealing DAAM1 as a novel predictive biomarker for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.", "ArticleAbstract": "", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36311166": {"ArticleTitle": "The Tumor Immune Profile of Murine Ovarian Cancer Models: An Essential Tool For Ovarian Cancer Immunotherapy Research.", "ArticleAbstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer with an imperative need for new treatments. Immunotherapy has had marked success in some cancer types; however, clinical trials studying the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of EOC benefited less than 15% of patients. Given that EOC develops from multiple tissues in the reproductive system and metastasizes widely throughout the peritoneal cavity, responses to immunotherapy are likely hindered by heterogeneous tumor microenvironments (TME) containing a variety of immune profiles. To fully characterize and compare syngeneic model systems that may reflect this diversity, we determined the immunogenicity of six ovarian tumor models in vivo, the T and myeloid profile of orthotopic tumors and the immune composition and cytokine profile of ascites, by single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry and IHC. The selected models reflect the different cellular origins of EOC (ovarian and fallopian tube epithelium) and harbor mutations relevant to human disease, including Tp53 mutation, PTEN suppression, and constitutive KRAS activation. ID8-p53-/- and ID8-C3 tumors were most highly infiltrated by T cells, whereas STOSE and MOE-PTEN/KRAS tumors were primarily infiltrated by tumor associated macrophages and were unique in MHC class I and II expression. MOE-PTEN/KRAS tumors were capable of forming T cell clusters. This panel of well-defined murine EOC models reflects some of the heterogeneity found in human disease and can serve as a valuable resource for studies that aim to test immunotherapies, explore the mechanisms of immune response to therapy, and guide selection of treatments for patient populations.", "Query": "Cancer", "Mesh": []}, "36311161": {"ArticleTitle": "Barriers to the Cervical Cancer Screening by CPC-28 Questionnaire: A Pilot Study.", "ArticleAbstract": "The aim of this study was to identify and compare barriers to cervical cancer screening (CCS) between women seeking and not seeking CCS by CPC-28 questionnaire ('Creencias, Papanicolaou, Cancer-28' questionnaire - Beliefs about Papanicolaou and Cervical Cancer).A pilot study was performed in 20 gynecological departments, each department sending data from five healthy women and five untreated women with cervical cancer. The women completed a validated and standardized questionnaire with 28 statements (the CPC-28 questionnaire). The participants were divided into women not seeking CCS (8 healthy women vs 30 women with cervical cancer) and women seeking CCS (54 healthy women vs 43 women with cervical cancer). A four-point Likert scale (item score from 1 to 4) was used to assess responses. A linear transformation was made to calculate the responses. Differences with a p value of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.The women not seeking CCS vs those seeking CCS had higher barriers according to Domain 1 of the CPC-28 (median; interquartile range: 33.33; 28.70-40.74 vs 14.82; 7.41-29.63; p<0.001). The risk of not seeking CCS was statistically significant in non-working (OR; 95 % CI: 2.458; 1.127-5.358; p<0.024), non-childbearing women (OR; 95 % CI: 3.302; 1.421-7.671; p<0.006) and women without cervical cancer (OR; 95 % CI: 4.709; 1.960-11.317; p<0.001).We identified barriers to having a Pap test in both of our groups.

The heterogeneity of the osteoimmune microenvironment in the osseointegration of implant materials remains elusive. Here, a single-cell study involving 40043\u00a0cells is conducted, and a total of 10 distinct cell clusters are identified from five different groups. A preliminary description of the osteoimmune microenvironment revealed the diverse cellular heterogeneity and dynamic changes modulated by implant properties. The increased immature neutrophils, Ly6C\u00a0+\u00a0CCR2hi monocytes, and S100a8hi macrophages induce an aggressive inflammatory response and eventually lead to the formation of fibrous capsule around the stainless steel implant. The enrichment of mature neutrophils, FcgR1hi and differentiated immunomodulatory macrophages around the titanium implant indicates favorable osseointegration under moderate immune response. Neutrophil-depletion mice are conducted to explore the role of neutrophils in osseointegration. Neutrophils may improve bone formation by enhancing the recruitment of BMSCs via the CXCL12/CXCR3 signal axis.

The identification of cell types for spleen and lymph nodes is helpful for understanding the mechanism of immune system. However, the cell types of spleen and lymph are highly diverse in the human body. Therefore, in this study, we employed a series of machine learning algorithms to computationally analyze the cell types of spleen and lymph based on single-cell CITE-seq sequencing data. A total of 28,211 cell data (training vs. test = 14,435 vs. 13,776) involving 24 cell types were collected for this study. For the training dataset, it was analyzed by Boruta and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) one by one, resulting in an mRMR feature list. This list was fed into the incremental feature selection (IFS) method, incorporating four classification algorithms (deep forest, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, and decision tree). Some essential features were discovered and the deep forest with its optimal features achieved the best performance. A group of related proteins (CD4, TCRb, CD103, CD43, and CD23) and genes (Nkg7 and Thy1) contributing to the classification of spleen and lymph nodes cell types were analyzed. Furthermore, the classification rules yielded by decision tree were also provided and analyzed.
