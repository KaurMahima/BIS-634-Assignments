        "ArticleTitle": "Association of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Pathologies With Scam Susceptibility in Older Adults.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Scam susceptibility is associated with adverse financial and health outcomes, including an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Very little is known about the role of cerebrovascular pathologies with scam susceptibility.To examine the association of diverse cerebrovascular pathologies (globally and regionally) with scam susceptibility.This clinical-pathological cohort study included participants from 2 ongoing studies of aging that began enrollment in 1994 and 1997. In 2010, participants were enrolled in the decision-making and behavioral economics substudy and were followed up for a mean (SD) of 3.4 (2.6) years prior to death. From 1365 older persons with clinical evaluations, 69 were excluded for having dementia at baseline. From 538 older persons who died, 408 had annual assessments for scam susceptibility, cardiovascular risk burden, and cognitive function and consented to brain donation for detailed neuropathologic examination. Data were analyzed from June 2021 through September 2022.Neuropathologic examination identified the presence of macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and common neurodegenerative pathologies (Alzheimer disease, limbic-predominant age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy, and Lewy bodies).There was a total of 408 participants. The mean (SD) age at death\u2009was\u200991 (6.1) years, the mean (SD) amount of education\u2009was\u200915.6 (3.1) years, and 297 (73%) were women. Participants included 4 Latino individuals (1%), 7 non-Latino Black individuals (2%), and 397 non-Latino White individuals (97%). The frequency of participants with macroscopic infarcts was 38% (n\u2009=\u2009154), microinfarcts was 40% (n\u2009=\u2009163), and moderate to severe vessel disease; specifically, atherosclerosis was 20% (n\u2009=\u200983), arteriolosclerosis was 25% (n\u2009=\u2009100), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy was 35% (n\u2009=\u2009143). In linear regression models adjusted for demographics and neurodegenerative pathologies, macroscopic infarcts were associated with greater scam susceptibility (estimate [SE], 0.18 [0.07]; P\u2009=\u2009.009). This association persisted after adjusting for cardiovascular risk burden and global cognition. Regionally, infarcts localized to the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes and thalamus were associated with greater scam susceptibility. Neither arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, nor microinfarcts were associated with scam susceptibility.Cerebrovascular pathologies, specifically cerebral infarcts, is linked with greater scam susceptibility in older adults, independent of common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Future studies examining in vivo magnetic resonance imaging markers of cerebrovascular pathologies with scam susceptibility and related decision-making outcomes will be important.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurodegeneration underpins the pathological processes of younger-onset dementia (YOD) and has been implicated in primary psychiatric disorders (PSYs). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) has been used to investigate neurodegeneration severity through correlation with structural brain changes in various conditions, but has seldom been evaluated in YOD and PSYs.This retrospective study included patients with YOD or PSYs with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and CSF NfL analysis. Findings from brain MRI were analysed using automated volumetry (volBrain) to measure white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and whole brain (WB) volumes expressed as percentages of total intracranial volume. Correlations between NfL and brain volume measurements were computed whilst adjusting for age.Seventy patients (47 with YOD and 23 with PSY) were identified. YOD types included Alzheimer disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. PSY included schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. MRI brain sequences were either fast spoiler gradient-echo (FSPGR) or magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE). In the total cohort, higher NfL was associated with reduced WB in the FSPGR and MPRAGE sequences (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.402 [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.593 to -0.147], P\u00a0=\u00a00.008 and r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.625 [95% CI, -0.828 to -0.395], P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Higher NfL was related to reduced GM in FSPGR (r\u00a0=\u00a00.385 [95% CI, -0.649 to -0.014], P\u00a0=\u00a00.017) and reduced WM in MPRAGE (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.650 [95% CI, -0.777 to -0.307], P\u2009<\u20090.001). Similar relationships were seen in YOD, but not in PSY.Higher CSF NfL is related to brain atrophy in YOD, further supporting its use as a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration severity.",

There is an increasing need to improve timely identification of individuals who will likely progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia particularly among under-represented, underserved, and vulnerable populations. The rapidly evolving area of bioinformatics of health system data and the emergence of fluid-based biomarkers for pre-symptomatic AD may provide an innovative strategic option for health system planners. A think-tank style meeting entitled \"The Campaign to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease Work Group on Community-Based Detection and Assessment of Cognitive Decline\" developed recommendations to guide future sustainability activities, public policy campaigns, and implementation pilots. The group identified and explored different pathways of community-based detection using electronic health records, from different international health-care systems, to detect and surveil individuals with early possible cognitive impairment.",

Over 25% of COVID-19 patients report neurological symptoms such as memory loss, anosmia, hyposmia, confusion, and headaches. The neurological outcomes may be a result of viral entry into the CNS and/or resulting neuroinflammation, both of which underlie an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we ask: Is COVID-19 a risk factor for AD? To answer, we identify the literature and review mechanisms by which COVID-19-mediated neuroinflammation can contribute to the development of AD, evaluate the effects of acute versus chronic phases of infection, and lastly, discuss potential therapeutics to address the rising rates of COVID-19 neurological sequelae.",

Whether the association of CCL2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of AD is still controversial.We aimed to investigate whether CCL2 rs4586 SNP is associated with the pathological changes and cognitive decline of AD.A total of 486 participants with longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and phospho-tau (P-tau) biomarkers, 18F-Florbetapir and 18F-flortaucipir-positron emission tomography (PET), and cognitive assessments from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative were included in the study. The effects of CCL2 rs4586 SNP on the pathological changes and cognitive decline of AD were assessed with linear mixed-effects models and evaluated according to the A\u03b2-status so as to identify whether the effects were independent of A\u03b2 status.CCL2 rs4586-CC carriers exhibited a slower global A\u03b2-PET accumulation, particularly within stage I and stage II. However, they exhibited a faster accumulation of CSF P-tau and global tau-PET standard uptake value ratios, especially in Braak I and Braak III/IV and the inferior temporal gyrus. The congruent effects of CCL2 rs4586 on tau accumulation existed only in the A\u03b2-group, as is shown in global tau-PET and Braak I. However, CCL2 rs4586 was not associated with the cognitive decline.Our findings showed that the CCL2 rs4586-CC (versus TT/TC) genotype was associated with slower A\u03b2 deposition and faster tau accumulation, and the latter of which were independent of A\u03b2 status.",

Here, we targeted hypothalamus, a hub of the motivation circuit.To examine hypothalamic resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in relation to apathy.We performed whole-brain regression of hypothalamic rsFC against Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) total score and behavioral, cognitive, and emotional subscores in 29 patients with AD/MCI and 28 healthy controls (HC), controlling for age, sex, education, cognitive status, and depression. We evaluated the results at a corrected threshold and employed path analyses to assess possible interaction between hypothalamic rsFCs, apathy and depression/memory. Finally, we re-examined the findings in a subsample of amyloid-\u03b2-verified AD.AES total score correlated negatively with hypothalamic precuneus (PCu)/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and positively with left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and supramarginal gyrus rsFCs. Behavioral subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic PCu/PCC and positively with middle frontal gyrus rsFC. Cognitive subscore correlated positively with hypothalamic MTG rsFC. Emotional subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic calcarine cortex rsFC. In path analyses, hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC negatively modulated apathy and, in turn, depression. The model where hypothalamic MTG rsFC and memory independently modulated apathy also showed a good fit. The findings of diminished hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC in relation to apathy and depression were confirmed in amyloid-verified AD.The findings together support a role of altered hypothalamic connectivity in relation to apathy and depression, and modulation of apathy by memory dysfunction.",

They also completed a user-experience questionnaire.Test-retest reliabilities varied for individual measures (ICCs\u200a=\u200a0.20 to 0.83). Global cognition composites showed excellent reliability (ICCs\u200a> \u200a0.8 over 1-month follow-up). A strong relationship between a combination of CNA measures and paper-and-pencil battery was found (canonical correlation R\u200a=\u200a0.87, p\u200a=\u200a0.04). Most tests were rated as enjoyable with easy-to-understand instructions. Ratings of general experience with online testing were mostly favorable; few had difficulty concentrating (17% ) or using the computer for tasks (10% ), although over one-third experienced performance anxiety (38% ).A combined brief online battery selected from two CNAs demonstrated robust psychometric standards for reliability (global composite), and convergent validity with a gold standard battery, and mostly good usability and acceptability in the remote testing environment.",

To compare these findings with an age- and gender-matched subject with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD).he brains were assessed macro- and microscopically and the proteinopathies were staged according to current recommendations.The AD neuropathological change (ADNC) was more extensive in the mutation carrier, although both individuals reached a high level of ADNC. The transactive DNA binding protein 43 pathology was at the end-stage in the index subject, a finding not previously described in familial AD. This pathology was moderate in the sAD subject. The PSEN1 G206R subject displayed full-blown alpha-synuclein pathology, while this proteinopathy was absent in the sAD case. Additionally, the mutation carrier displayed pronounced neuroinflammation, not previously described in association with PSEN1 mutations.Our findings are exceptional, as the PSEN1 G206R subject displayed an end-stage pathology of every common proteinopathy. It is unclear whether the observed alterations are caused by the mutation or are related to a cross-seeding mechanisms. The pronounced neuroinflammation in the index patient can be reactive to the extensive NC or a contributing factor to the proteinopathies.

Participants were tested for serum cotinine, a validated cigarette smoking/exposure biomarker, and had standardized blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c measurements. Participants were administered four cognitive tests: Digit Symbol Substitution (DSST), Animal Fluency, Immediate Recall, and Delayed Recall. Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for demographics and confounders evaluated the association of cotinine with cognition. Interaction testing evaluated effect modification by hypertension, diabetes, and their continuous measures (systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c).For 3,007 participants, mean age was 69.4 years; 54% were women. Using cotinine levels, 14.9% of participants were categorized as active smokers. Higher cotinine levels were associated with worse DSST performance when modeling cotinine as a continuous variable (\u03b2, -0.70; 95% CI, -1.11, -0.29; p\u200a< \u200a0.01) and when categorizing participants as active smokers (\u03b2, -5.63; 95% CI, -9.70, -1.56; p\u200a< \u200a0.01). Cotinine was not associated with fluency or memory. Effect modification by hypertension and diabetes were absent, except that cotinine was associated with worse Immediate Recall at lower blood pressures.Higher levels of a smoking and secondhand exposure biomarker were associated with worse cognitive performance on a multidomain test. Overall, the relationship of cotinine with cognition was not contingent on or amplified by hypertension or diabetes; smoking is detrimental for brain health irrespective of these comorbidities.",

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression mainly through epigenetic modification, transcription, and posttranscriptional modification. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloidosis of the brain. However, the role of lncRNA ac4C modification in AD remains unclear.In this study, we investigated the association between ac4C modification and AD, and the underlying mechanisms of ac4C modification in AD.The male 9-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, age- and sex-matched wild type (WT) mice were used in this study. Then, ac4C-RIP-seq and RNA-seq were used to comprehensively analyze lncRNA ac4C modification in AD mice. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed the regulatory relationships among these three lncRNAs and AD.The results showed that there were 120 significantly different ac4C peaks located on 102 lncRNAs in AD, of which 55 were hyperacetylated and 47 were hypoacetylated. Simultaneously, 231 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, including 138 upregulated lncRNAs and 93 downregulated lncRNAs. Moreover, 3 lncRNAs, lncRNA Gm26508, lncRNA A430046D13Rik, and lncRNA 9530059O14Rik, showed significant changes in both the ac4C and RNA levels using conjoint analysis.The abundance of lncRNA ac4C modification is significantly different in AD and indicates that lncRNA ac4C is associated with the occurrence and development of AD, which could provide a basis for further exploration of the related regulatory mechanisms.",

These associations were significantly stronger in participants who were older (50-90 years), female, of Malay and Indian ethnicity (compared with Chinese), and less educated.In this multi-ethnic Asian population, demographics, vascular risk factors, and lifestyle behaviors were associated with HGS. Additionally, higher HGS was associated with substantially better cognitive function, which association was modified by age, sex, ethnicity, and education level.",

Multi-component interventions are challenging to evaluate due to program complexity and personalization to individual needs and contexts. This paper describes a multi-level process evaluation conducted alongside the BetterBrains RCT.To understand how and why the BetterBrains intervention was effective or ineffective at reducing cognitive decline in healthy adults whilst considering the context in which it was implemented.1,510 non cognitively-deteriorated community-dwelling adults aged 40-70 years old at risk of cognitive decline will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. All BetterBrains intervention participants, coaches, and the research team will be included in the evaluation. A mixed-methods design will be used, guided by The Framework for Implementation Fidelity and the program logic model. Data will be sourced from interviews, focus groups, surveys, BetterBrains coach notes, participant weekly check-in surveys, and audio recordings of intervention coaching sessions. Quantitative data will be analyzed via descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative data will be analyzed using content and thematic analysis.The process evaluation will provide information about contextual and influencing factors related to the implementation of BetterBrains and the RCT outcomes.Understanding how BetterBrains was implemented and its associated impacts will inform the translation of the program into community and clinical settings, providing easy access to online, personalized dementia prevention services.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Adequate detection of symptoms and disease progression in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is complex. Dementia cohorts usually utilize cognitive and functional measures, which fail to detect dominant behavioural and social cognitive deficits in bvFTD. Moreover, since patients typically have a loss of insight, caregivers are important informants. This is the first qualitative study to investigate caregiver relevant symptoms during the disease course of bvFTD, aiming to improve tools for diagnosis, progression, and future clinical trials.Informal caregivers of patients in different disease stages of bvFTD (N\u00a0=\u00a020) were recruited from the neurology outpatient clinic of the Amsterdam UMC and a patient organization for peer support in the Netherlands. Their perspectives on clinical relevance were thoroughly explored during individual semi-structured interviews. Inductive content analysis with open coding was performed by two researchers independently to establish overarching themes and patterns.Caregivers reported a variety of symptoms, in which (i) loss of emotional connection, (ii) preoccupation and restlessness, and (iii) apathy and dependency compose major themes of relevance for diagnosis and treatment. Within heterogeneous disease trajectories, symptom presence differed between stages and among individuals, which is relevant in the context of progression and outcome measures. Significant socio-emotional changes dominated in early stages, while severe cognitive, behavioural, and physical deterioration shifted focus from predominant personality change to quality of life in later stages.Caregiver perspectives on target symptoms in bvFTD differ according to clinical stage and patient-caregiver characteristics, with significant socio-emotional changes characterizing early stages. These findings call for more appropriate tools and symptomatic treatments, as well as a personalized approach in treatment of bvFTD and a focus on early stage interventions in clinical trial design.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Olfactory impairment in older individuals is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Characterization of age versus neuropathology-associated changes in the brain olfactory pathway may elucidate processes underlying early AD pathogenesis. Here, we report age versus AD neuropathology-associated differential transcription in four brain regions in the olfactory pathway of 10 female African green monkeys (vervet, Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus), a well-described model of early AD-like neuropathology.Transcriptional profiles were determined by microarray in the olfactory bulb (OB), piriform cortex (PC), temporal lobe white matter (WM), and inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaque load in parietal and temporal cortex was determined by immunohistochemistry, and concentrations of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and norepinephrine in ITC were determined by enzyme-linked immuosorbent assay (ELISA). Transcriptional profiles were compared between middle-aged and old animals, and associations with AD-relevant neuropathological measures were determined.Transcriptional profiles varied by brain region and age group. Expression levels of TRO and RNU4-1 were significantly lower in all four regions in the older group. An additional 29 genes were differentially expressed by age in three of four regions. Analyses of a combined expression data set of all four regions identified 77 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by age group. Among these DEGs, older subjects had elevated levels of CTSB , EBAG9, LAMTOR3, and MRPL17, and lower levels of COMMD10 and TYW1B. A subset of these DEGs was associated with neuropathology biomarkers. Notably, CTSB was positively correlated with A\u03b2 plaque counts, A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratios, and norepinephrine levels in all brain regions.These data demonstrate age differences in gene expression in olfaction-associated brain regions. Biological processes exhibiting age-related enrichment included the regulation of cell death, vascular function, mitochondrial function, and proteostasis. A subset of DEGs was specifically associated with AD phenotypes. These may represent promising targets for future mechanistic investigations and perhaps therapeutic intervention.",

It plays a vital role in modulating cell protrusion, cell migration, morphogenesis, adhesion, endocytosis and phagocytosis. A large number of studies have also found that abnormally activated c-Abl plays an important role in a variety of pathologies, including various inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. c-Abl also plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases, mainly through mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress (OS), and Tau protein phosphorylation. Inhibiting expression or activity of this kinase has certain neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects and can also improve cognition and behavior. Blockers of this kinase may have good preventive and treatment effects on neurodegenerative diseases. Cognitive dysfunction after anesthesia is also closely related to the abovementioned mechanisms. We infer that alterations in the expression and activity of c-Abl may underlie postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). This article summarizes the current understanding and research progress on the mechanisms by which c-Abl may be related to postoperative neurodegeneration.",

Previous studies have demonstrated increased responsiveness to NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome agonists, both in individuals with untreated T2DM in addition to those with established AD. We hypothesised that peripheral NLRP3 inflammasome responses may be altered during the early stages of T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction. Here, we assessed the relationship between NLPR3 responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (including to A\u03b2-42, the putative pathogenic protein in AD) and neuropsychological performance in uncomplicated midlife T2DM to identify early signatures of immune dysregulation which may predispose to later cognitive decline. We recruited a cross-sectional cohort of middle-aged adults with uncomplicated T2DM and matched Healthy Controls (HCs) for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and in vitro PBMC responses to a range of NLRP3 agonists were assessed. T2DM was associated with subtle decrements on neuropsychological tests of delayed memory and executive function (both p<0.05). Overall, there were no differences between T2DM and HCs in immune responses induced by NLRP3 agonists. Further, we observed no relationship between the subtle neuropsychological decrements observed in T2DM and PBMC responsiveness to NLRP3 agonists. Our data suggests that peripheral NLRP3 inflammasome response dysregulation may not play a role in the early stages of cognitive dysfunction in midlife T2DM. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to examine the contribution of peripheral NLRP3 responses towards disease pathology and as cognitive decline accelerates in T2DM.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "A major pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of neurotoxic plaques composed of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptides in patients' brains. The pathway of plaque formation remains elusive, though some clues appear to lie in the dominant presence of A\u03b21 - 42 in these plaques despite A\u03b21-40 making up approximately 90% of the A\u03b2 pool. We hypothesize that this asymmetry is driven by the hydrophobicity of the two extra amino acids that are incorporated in A\u03b21-42. To investigate this hypothesis at the level of single molecules, we have developed a molecular \"sticker-and-spacer lattice model\" of unfolded A\u03b2. The model protein has a single sticker that may reversibly dimerise and elongate into semi-flexible linear chains. The growth is hampered by excluded-volume interactions that are encoded by the hydrophilic spacers but are rendered cooperative by the attractive interactions of hydrophobic spacers. For sufficiently strong hydrophobicity, the chains undergo liquid-liquid phase-separation (LLPS) into condensates that facilitate the nucleation of fibers. We find that a small fraction of A\u03b21-40 in a mixture of A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 shifts the critical concentration for LLPS to lower values. This study provides theoretical support for the hypothesis that LLPS condensates act as a precursor for aggregation and provides an explanation for the A\u03b21-42-enrichment of aggregates in terms of hydrophobic interactions.",

An increasing number of studies have shown that intestinal flora play a crucial role in regulating the brain-gut axis. Short-chain fatty acids are metabolites of intestinal flora that regulate hormone synthesis and play an essential role in microbial-intestinal-brain communication. An imbalance of intestinal flora can promote microglia to secrete proinflammatory factors, cause nerve inflammation, and then affect cognitive and learning ability. However, the mechanism is not clear. From this, we infer that endogenous hormones may be the medium for intestinal flora to affect the process of AD. This review of the relationships among AD, endogenous hormones, and intestinal flora expounds on the critical role of various hormones in the brain-gut axis. It discusses intervention measures aimed at intestinal flora to prevent or delay AD occurrence.

Nevertheless, the reliability of SR results can be limited by methodological flaws. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the methodological quality of SRs on AD treatments, along with potentially relevant factors.To identify eligible SRs on AD treatments, four databases including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched. The Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 instrument was used for quality appraisal of SRs. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine factors related to methodological quality.A total of 102 SRs were appraised. Four (3.90%) SRs were considered as high quality; 14 (13.7%), 48 (47.1%), and 36 (35.3%) were as moderate, low, and critically low quality, respectively. The following significant methodological limitations were identified: only 22.5% of SRs registered protocols a priori, 6.9% discussed the rationales of chosen study designs, 21.6% gave a list of excluded studies with reasons, and 23.5% documented funding sources of primary studies. Cochrane SRs (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 31.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.81-266.9) and SRs of pharmacological treatments (AOR: 3.96, 95%CI: 1.27-12.3) were related to the higher overall methodological quality of SRs.Methodological quality of SRs on AD treatments is unsatisfactory, especially among non-Cochrane SRs and SRs of non-pharmacological interventions. Improvement in the following methodological domains requires particular attention due to poor performance: registering and publishing protocols a priori, justifying study design selection, providing a list of excluded studies, and reporting funding sources of primary studies.",

Previous studies reported activation of FPR2 by A\u03b21-42, but further investigation of other FPRs and A\u03b2 variants is needed. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the interactions of mouse and human FPRs with different physiologically relevant A\u03b2-peptides using transiently transfected cells in combination with calcium imaging. We observed that, in addition to hFPR2, all other hFPRs also responded to A\u03b21-42, A\u03b21-40, and the naturally occurring variants A\u03b211-40 and A\u03b217-40. Notably, A\u03b211-40 and A\u03b217-40 are very potent activators of mouse and human FPR1, acting at nanomolar concentrations. Buffer composition and aggregation state are extremely crucial factors that critically affect the interaction of A\u03b2 with different FPR subtypes. To investigate the physiological relevance of these findings, we examined the effects of A\u03b211-40 and A\u03b217-40 on the human glial cell line U87. Both peptides induced a strong calcium flux at concentrations that very similar to those obtained in experiments for hFPR1 in HEK cells. Further immunocytochemistry, qPCR, and pharmacological experiments verified that these responses were primarily mediated through hFPR1. Chemotaxis experiments revealed that A\u03b2 11-40 but not A\u03b2 17-40 evoked cell migration, which argues for a functional selectivity of different A\u03b2 peptides. Together, these findings provide the first evidence that not only hFPR2 but also hFPR1 and hFPR3 may contribute to neuroinflammation in AD through an interaction with different A\u03b2 variants.",

For that, a total concentration of 100 \u03bcM of peptides consisting of a mixture of native and tagged ones (up to 10% in moles), was applied. Results demonstrated that FITC had a strong inhibition effect upon the aggregation behavior of A\u03b2(1-42), while for A\u03b2(1-40), only a retardation in kinetics was observed. It was also shown that when mixed solutions of A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) are used, the A\u03b2(1-42) alloform was the leading peptide in the aggregation process, and when the latter was tagged the aggregation kinetics decreased but the lifetime of potentially toxic oligomers was drastically increased.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Being the most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a series of modifiable risk factors, including metal ions represented by aluminium. Aluminium (Al) exhibits its neurotoxic effects, especially mainly by affecting amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) aggregation and Tau hyperphosphorylation. As reported in our previous study, the combination of Alpinia Oxyphylla Fructus and Schisandra Chinensis Fructus (AS) had a neuroprotective effect. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-AD effect of AS and the mechanism by which AS reduces the neurotoxic effect of Al. Firstly, we used aluminium-maltol (Al(mal)3) to construct a mouse model of AD and performed oral administration of AS, followed by behavioral experiments, and we collected the mouse brain for immunohistochemistry analysis. In vivo results showed that AS significantly improved Al-induced cognitive decline in mice, and reduced the levels of A\u03b21-42 and P-Tau in the brain, which further proved the anti-AD effect of AS. Then, in order to explore the mechanism by which AS reduced A\u03b21-42, Al-induced PC12 cells were used for the in vitro experiments. Compared with other ratios, the ratio of Alpinia Oxyphylla Fructus: Schisandra Chinensis Fructus (AO:SC) = 1:2 could better improve the cell viability and reduce the A\u03b21-42 level. Accroding to western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, AS ameliorated the pathological process by downregulating the expression of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), rather than by reducing the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Tau. These results suggest that AS ameliorated Al-induced AD by affecting the expression of BACE1 and reducing the level of A\u03b21-42, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect. Combined with previous studies, this study shows that AS has potential for further research and development in AD treatment.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Genetic studies have highlighted microglia as pivotal in orchestrating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia that adhere to A\u03b2 plaques acquire a transcriptional signature, \"disease-associated microglia\" (DAM), which largely emanates from the TREM2-DAP12 receptor complex that transmits intracellular signals through the protein tyrosine kinase SYK. The human TREM2R47H variant associated with high AD risk fails to activate microglia via SYK. We found that SYK-deficient microglia cannot encase A\u03b2 plaques, accelerating brain pathology and behavioral deficits. SYK deficiency impaired the PI3K-AKT-GSK-3\u03b2-mTOR pathway, incapacitating anabolic support required for attaining the DAM profile. However, SYK-deficient microglia proliferated and advanced to an Apoe-expressing prodromal stage of DAM; this pathway relied on the adapter DAP10, which also binds TREM2. Thus, microglial responses to A\u03b2 involve non-redundant SYK- and DAP10-pathways. Systemic administration of an antibody against CLEC7A, a receptor that directly activates SYK, rescued microglia activation in mice expressing the TREM2R47H allele, unveiling new options for AD immunotherapy.",

Of the remaining 26 EOAD cases without mutations in APP/PSENs, the proportion of carrying rare variants of genes involved in A\u03b2 and APP metabolism was significantly higher than that of controls (84.6% vs. 73.1%, P=0.042). Thirty-one risk genes with 47 variants were identified in 22 patients. However, in 26 normal subjects, only 20 risk genes with 29 variants were identified in 19 subjects.Our findings demonstrate the role of APP/PSENs mutations in EOAD, identifying a new PSEN2 missense mutation, and further offer valuable insights into the potential genetic mechanisms of EOAD without APP/PSENs mutations among Han Chinese.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative condition, the most common cause of dementia, and a leading cause of disability and death globally. Mounting evidence supported accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) as the primary cause of AD pathology and sprouted a number of candidate treatments engaging A\u03b2 from its production to its clearance, yet no amyloid-based drug candidate had been proven effective. Alternative pathomechanisms have been proposed, but still current treatments are limited to symptomatic therapy. Aducanumab (BIIB-037) is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively binds aggregated forms of A\u03b2, inhibits its template activity and promotes clearance of A\u03b2 deposits. Three early terminated trials in humans are available. Overall, conflicting results exist over measures of clinical efficacy, despite an objective decrease in A\u03b2 burden. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities emerge as the most significant treatment-related adverse event. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the available evidence on aducanumab, a drug that recently received a debated accelerated approval for the treatment of mild AD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

Objective This study aimed to investigate the effects EA on learning and memory dysfunction as well as oxidative stress in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Methods The studied rats were treated according to the following protocol: Control (group 1) and scopolamine (group 2) groups received saline (intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)) while the treatment groups (group 3-5) were given EA (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 weeks. Thereafter, their behavioral performance was evaluated using Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tasks. Notably, scopolamine was injected (into groups II-V at a dose of 2 mg/kg, i.p.) before conducting the tasks. Finally, the oxidative stress indicators in the brain were measured. Results EA reduced the escape latencies and distances during learning phase of MWM. The results of probe trials also indicated that EA improved memory retrieval and helped the animals recall the platform. Moreover, EA increased delay and light time, while decreasing the frequency of entries to the dark area of PA. In the EA-treated groups, the level of malondialdehyde was decreased, while the levels of total thiol groups, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were increased. Conclusion EA prevented the negative effects of scopolamine on learning and memory which is probably mediated via modulating oxidative stress. Hence, EA could be considered as a potential alternative therapy in dementia.",

The main pathological features of the disease are extracellular deposition of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein. The understanding of factors contributing to AD progression, number of molecular signatures, and the development of therapeutic agents played a significant role in the discovery of disease-modifying drugs to treat the disease. Bioinformatics has established its significance in many areas of biology. The role of bioinformatics, in drug discovery is emerging significantly and will continue to evolve. In recent years, different bioinformatics methodologies, viz. protein signaling pathway, molecular signature differences between different classes drugs, interacting profiles of drugs and their potential therapeutic mechanisms have been applied to identify potential therapeutic targets of AD. Bioinformatics tools were also found to contribute in the discovery of novel drugs, omics-based biomarkers, and drug repurposing for AD.

These biochemical and cell biological mechanisms for A\u03b2-induced neuronal dysfunction may underlie learning and memory defects in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that KIF11 overexpression rescues A\u03b2-mediated decreases in dendritic spine density in cultured neurons and in long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices. Furthermore, Kif11 overexpression from a transgene prevented spatial learning deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Finally, increased KIF11 expression in neuritic plaque-positive AD patients' brains was associated with better cognitive performance and higher expression of synaptic protein mRNAs. Taken together, these mechanistic biochemical, cell biological, electrophysiological, animal model, and human data identify KIF11 as a key target of A\u03b2-mediated toxicity in AD, which damages synaptic structures and functions critical for learning and memory in AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, being highly prevalent in elderly women. The advanced progression may be due to decreased hormone synthesis during post-menopause as estradiol and progesterone both have neuroprotective potentials. We aimed to confirm that female hormone depletion aggravates the progression of dementia in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD). As pathological hallmarks are known to appear in 6-month-old animals, we expected to see disease-like changes in the 4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice only after hormone depletion. Three-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice were compared with their age-matched controls. As a menopause model, ovaries were removed (OVX or Sham surgery). After 1-month recovery, the body composition of the animals was measured by an MRI scan. The cognitive and anxiety parameters were evaluated by different behavioral tests, modeling different aspects (Y-maze, Morris water maze, open-field, social discrimination, elevated plus maze, light-dark box, fox odor, operant conditioning, and conditioned fear test). At the end of the experiment, uterus was collected, amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation, and the cholinergic system in the brain was examined by immunohistochemistry. The uterus weight decreased, and the body weight increased significantly in the OVX animals. The MRI data showed that the body weight change can be due to fat accumulation. Moreover, OVX increased anxiety in control, but decreased in 3xTg-AD animals, the later genotype being more anxious by default based on the anxiety z-score. In general, 3xTg-AD mice moved less. In relation to cognition, neither the 3xTg-AD genotype nor OVX surgery impaired learning and memory in general. Despite no progression of dementia-like behavior after OVX, at the\u00a0histological level, OVX aggravated the amyloid-\u03b2 plaque deposition in the basolateral amygdala and induced early cholinergic neuronal fiber loss in the somatosensory cortex of the transgenic animals. We confirmed that OVX induced menopausal symptoms. Removal of the sexual steroids aggravated the appearance of AD-related alterations in the brain without significantly affecting the behavior. Thus, the OVX in young, 3-month-old 3xTg-AD mice might be a suitable model for testing the effect of new treatment options on structural changes; however, to reveal any beneficial effect on behavior, a later time point might be needed.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The risk of developing Alzheimer disease is increased after stroke and this association may not solely be driven by traditional vascular risk factors. Neuronal death leads to release of tau proteins which can become dephosphorylated, rephosphorylated or hyperphosphorylated in the setting of ischemia, possibly leading to formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, a potential synergistic effect between development of tauopathy and cerebrovascular lesion burden may contribute to cognitive decline after stroke. We explored the spatial and temporal distribution of neurofibrillary tangles after ischemic stroke in vivo by using 18F-MK-6240 positron emission tomography (PET).We included patients with a first ischemic stroke to undergo longitudinal 18F-MK-6240 PET/MR within 2 to 4 weeks and 6 months after stroke. For cross-sectional analyses, we also included age-matched healthy controls. We delineated 5 volumes-of-interest based on T2 FLAIR and T1 MR data: the ischemic lesion, 3 consecutive peri-ischemic areas and the remaining ipsilesional hemisphere. We performed region-based voxel-wise partial volume correction on the PET data and calculated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) with the cerebellum as reference region.We did not quantify PET scans of patients within the first month after stroke (n = 17; median age 73 years [IQR: 62-82]) since the signal intensity was influenced by blood brain barrier breakdown hampering a reliable data analysis. At 6 months after the event (n = 13; median age 71 years [IQR: 60-79]), 18F-MK-6240 SUVR was increased in the ischemic lesion compared to 20 age-matched healthy controls (median age 71.5 years [IQR: 66-76]; ratiolesion/controls = 1.62\u00b10.54; one-sample t-test: p = 0.0015) and gradually decreased in the surrounding tissue (one-way within-subject ANOVA(F(1.2, 14.8) = 18.0, p = 0.00043).These findings suggest that neurofibrillary tangles may form after ischemic stroke and spread in the peri-ischemic brain parenchyma. Further follow up is required to gain more insight in the spatial and temporal dynamics of this tauopathy after ischemic stroke.",

In particular, neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease constitute a major health and socio-economic challenge with increasing incidence in many industrialized countries with aging populations. Recent work has established the primary role of abnormal protein accumulation and the spread of disease-specific deposits in brain as a factor in neurotoxicity and disruption of functional networks. A range of therapeutics from small molecules to antibodies targeting these proteinopathies are now in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. These studies are methodologically challenging owing to difficulty of accurate diagnosis in early disease, the slow and variable rates of progression between individuals, and efficacy measures which may be cofounded by the symptomatic improvements due to treatment that does not reflect disease course modification. Further, the ideal candidates for these treatments would be at-risk, or premanifest persons in whom the pathological process of the neurodegenerative disorder has begun, but who are clinically normal and extremely difficult to identify. Scintigraphic imaging with PET and SPECT in trials offers the opportunity to interrogate pathophysiologic processes like protein deposition with high specificity. This review summarizes the current implementation of these imaging biomarkers and the implications for future management of neurodegenerative disorders and CNS drug development in general.",

The discovery of promising new AChE inhibitors using a hybridisation method is considered as one of the effective strategies to overcome AD. In this study, potent hybrid donepezils previously reported as AChE inhibitors were investigated to gain an insight into the key binding interaction of their scaffolds, using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations. The results indicated that the key interactions found in both donepezil and the selected hybrid donepezils were the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction to Trp86 in the catalytic anionic site (CAS) and Trp286 and Tyr341 in the peripheral anionic site (PAS) in the AChE binding pocket. Moreover, the modification of the scaffolds revealed the adaptation of the orientation in the binding pocket and additional important interactions from the modified scaffold, such as H-bond and H-\u03c0 interactions to Asp74, Tyr124 and Tyr337. In addition, the HOMO-LUMO prediction indicated the binding interaction by considering the electron transfer between the hybrid donepezils and key residues, such as Trp86 and Trp286. The bioavailability, drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics predictions confirmed the suitability of the hybrid donepezils for AD drug development. Most of the selected hybrid donepezils revealed good bioavailability, drug-likeness properties and pharmacokinetics; however, some need improved pharmacokinetic properties. The obtained information highlights the significance of the scaffold from the hybridisation method, which will be helpful for AD drug design and development in the future.",

In the current study, we explored the cytotoxic signal transduction pathway in 42-amino-acid A\u03b2 (A\u03b242)-treated HeLa cells in relation to the increase in CCC. The increase in CCC was prominent in cells treated twice with oligomeric A\u03b242. We previously showed that double treatment also promoted A\u03b2-induced lamin fragmentation (AILF), which appears to be mediated by cathepsin L. Apoptotic caspase activation was a downstream event of AILF. The Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM suppressed cell death, cathepsin L activation, AILF, and caspase activation in A\u03b2-treated cells. These results indicate that A\u03b242 induces an increase in CCC, which is an event upstream of the cytotoxic processes. The products of AILF are different from those produced by other cell death-inducing agents, such as staurosporine, which induces caspase-6-mediated lamin fragmentation (CMLF). CMLF was unaffected by BAPTA-AM and was not detected in cells treated with A\u03b242, indicating that A\u03b242 peptide induced a specific cytotoxic pathway involving AILF via increased CCC.

All the ASRs in women were consistently higher than those in men, but the increases were more pronounced in men. In addition, the ASRs of incidence, prevalence, and DALYs were positively correlated with the SDI. Moreover, the proportion of patients over 70 years old with dementia was also positively correlated with the SDI level. Smoking was a major risk factor for the disease burden of dementia in men, while obesity was the major risk factor for women.From 1990 to 2019, the Alzheimer's disease burden increased worldwide. This trend was more serious in high-SDI areas, especially among elderly populations in high-SDI areas, who should receive additional attention. Policy-makers should take steps to reverse this situation. Notably, women were at a higher risk for the disease, but the risk in men showed a faster increase. We should give attention to the aging population, attach importance to interventions targeting dementia risk factors, and formulate action plans to address the increasing incidence of dementia.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "This paper introduces an indoor-monitoring LiDAR sensor for patients with Alzheimer disease residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), and this sensor exploits an optoelectronic analog front-end (AFE) to detect light signals from targets by utilizing on-chip avalanche photodiodes (APDs) realized in a 180 nm CMOS process and a neural processing unit (NPU) used for motion detection and decisions, especially for incidents of falls occurring in LTCFs. The AFE consists of an on-chip CMOS P+/N-well APD, a linear-mode transimpedance amplifier, a post-amplifier, and a time-to-digital converter, whereas the NPU exploits network sparsity and approximate processing elements for low-power operation. This work provides a potential solution of low-cost, low-power, indoor-monitoring LiDAR sensors for patients with Alzheimer disease in LTCFs.",

Experimentally, alloxan (100 mg/kg body weight (b.w.))-induced diabetic rats (200-250 g) were divided into seven groups (n = 6). Group I: normal control, Group II: diabetic control, Group III: standard treated with glibenclamide and Group lV-VII: treated with methanolic crude extracts (100, 200 mg/kg), nuciferine and norcoclaurine (10 mg/kg b.w.) for 15 days. Different tests were performed, including blood glucose, body weights and antioxidant enzyme assays, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase test (CAT), lipid peroxidation assay (TBARS), glutathione assay (GSH) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) assay. Nuciferine and norcoclaurine significantly reduced blood glucose (p &lt; 0.05) and restored body weight in diabetic rats. Moreover, nuciferine and norcoclaurine (10 mg/kg) significantly recovered the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH) which decreased during induced diabetes. Significant increase in TBARS was also observed in the diabetic group and nuciferine as well as norcoclaurine (10 mg/kg) inhibited the increase in TBARS in diabetic animals (p &lt; 0.05), as compared to glibenclamide. AChE activity was significantly recovered by nuciferine and norcoclaurine (10 mg/kg) both in the blood and brain of the diabetic group (p &lt; 0.05). Nuciferine and norcoclaurine showed potent inhibitory effects against \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase with IC50, 19.06 \u00b1 0.03, 15.03 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcM and 24.07 \u00b1 0.05, 18.04 \u00b1 0.021 \u03bcM, as confirmed by molecular docking studies. This study concludes that nuciferine and norcoclaurine significantly improve memory and could be considered as an effective phytomedicine for diabetes, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and oxidative stress.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The vast socio-economic impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has prompted the search for new neuroprotective agents with good tolerability and safety profile. With its outstanding role as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, alongside its anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, the artichoke can be implemented in a multi-targeted approach in AD therapy. Moreover, artichoke agricultural wastes can represent according to the current United Nations Sustainable Development goals an opportunity to produce medicinally valuable phenolic-rich extracts. In this context, the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS phytochemical characterization of artichoke bracts extract revealed the presence of mono- and di-caffeoylquinic acids and apigenin, luteolin, and kaempferol O-glycosides with remarkable total phenolics and flavonoids contents. A broad antioxidant spectrum was established in vitro. Artichoke-loaded, chitosan-coated, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were prepared and characterized for their size, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency, release, and ex vivo permeation and showed suitable colloidal characteristics, a controlled release profile, and promising ex vivo permeation, indicating possibly better physicochemical and biopharmaceutical parameters than free artichoke extract. The anti-Alzheimer potential of the extract and prepared SLNs was assessed in vivo in streptozotocin-induced sporadic Alzheimer mice. A great improvement in cognitive functions and spatial memory recovery, in addition to a marked reduction of the inflammatory biomarker TNF-\u03b1, \u03b2-amyloid, and tau protein levels, were observed. Significant neuroprotective efficacy in dentate Gyrus sub-regions was achieved in mice treated with free artichoke extract and to a significantly higher extent with artichoke-loaded SLNs. The results clarify the strong potential of artichoke bracts extract as a botanical anti-AD drug and will contribute to altering the future medicinal outlook of artichoke bracts previously regarded as agro-industrial waste.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, is currently incurable. Imbalanced amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) generation and clearance are thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD. Historically, strategies targeting A\u03b2 clearance have typically focused on central clearance, but with limited clinical success. Recently, the contribution of peripheral systems, particularly the liver, to A\u03b2 clearance has sparked an increased interest. In addition, AD presents pathological features similar to those of metabolic syndrome, and the critical involvement of brain energy metabolic disturbances in this disease has been recognized. More importantly, the liver may be a key regulator in these abnormalities, far beyond our past understanding. Here, we review recent animal and clinical findings indicating that liver dysfunction represents an early event in AD pathophysiology. We further propose that compromised peripheral A\u03b2 clearance by the liver and aberrant hepatic physiological processes may contribute to AD neurodegeneration. The role of a hepatic synthesis product, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), in the management of AD is also discussed. A deeper understanding of the communication between the liver and brain may lead to new opportunities for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD.",

Due to the failure of many single therapies targeting the two hallmarks, A\u03b2 and Tau, and the multifactorial etiology of AD, there is now more and more interest in nutraceutical agents with multiple effects such as Moringa oleifera (MO) that have strong anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anticholinesterase, and neuroprotective virtues. In this study, we treated APP/PS1 mice with a methanolic extract of MO for four months and evaluated its effect on AD-related pathology in these mice using a multitude of behavioral, biochemical, and histochemical tests. Our data revealed that MO improved behavioral deficits such as anxiety-like behavior and hyperactivity and cognitive, learning, and memory impairments. MO treatment abrogated the A\u03b2 burden to wild-type control mice levels via decreasing BACE1 and AEP and upregulating IDE, NEP, and LRP1 protein levels. Moreover, MO improved synaptic plasticity by improving the decreased GluN2B phosphorylation, the synapse-related proteins PSD95 and synapsin1 levels, the quantity and quality of dendritic spines, and neurodegeneration in the treated mice. MO is a nutraceutical agent with promising therapeutic potential that can be used in the management of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment due to a severe loss of cholinergic neurons in specific brain areas. It is the most common type of dementia in the aging population. Although many anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) drugs are already available on the market, their performance sometimes yields unexpected results. For this reason, research works are ongoing to find potential anti-AChE agents both from natural and synthetic sources. In this study, 90 extracts from 30 native and naturalized medicinal plants are tested by TLC and Ellman's colorimetric assay at 250, 125 and 62.5 \u03bcg/mL in order to determine the inhibitory effect on AChE. In total, 21 out of 90 extracts show high anti-AChE activity (75-100% inhibition) in a dose-dependent manner. Among them, ethanolic extract from aerial parts of O. vulgare ssp. vulgare shows an IC50 value 7.7 times lower than galantamine. This research also establishes the chemical profile of oregano extract by TLC, HPLC-DAD and LC-MS, and twenty-three compounds are identified and quantified. Dihydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids are the most abundant ones (56.90 and 25.94%, respectively). Finally, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties are quantified by colorimetric methods. The total phenolic content is 207.64 \u00b1 0.69 \u00b5g/mg of extract. The antioxidant activity is measured against two radicals, DPPH and ABTS. In both assays, the oregano extract shows high activity. The Pearson correlation matrix shows the relationship between syringic acids, a type of dihydroxybenzoic acid, and anti-AChE (r2 = -0.9864) and antioxidant activity (r2 = 0.9409 and 0.9976). In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate promising potential new uses of these medicinal herbs for the treatment of Alzheimer's. Origanum vulgare ssp. vulgare and syringic acids, which have anti-AChE activity and beneficial antioxidant capacity, can be highlighted as potential candidates for the development of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other diseases characterized by a cholinergic deficit.",

Deep Learning (DL), a kind of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has paved the way for new AD detection and automation methods. The DL model's prediction accuracy depends on the dataset's size. The DL models lose their accuracy when the dataset has an imbalanced class problem. This study aims to use the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to develop a reliable and efficient method for identifying Alzheimer's disease using MRI. In this study, we offer a new CNN architecture for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease with a modest number of parameters, making it perfect for training a smaller dataset. This proposed model correctly separates the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and displays class activation patterns on the brain as a heat map. The proposed Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Network (DAD-Net) is developed from scratch to correctly classify the phases of Alzheimer's disease while reducing parameters and computation costs. The Kaggle MRI image dataset has a severe problem with class imbalance. Therefore, we used a synthetic oversampling technique to distribute the image throughout the classes and avoid the problem. Precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and loss are all used to compare the proposed DAD-Net against DEMENET and CNN Model. For accuracy, AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall, the DAD-Net achieved the following values for evaluation metrics: 99.22%, 99.91%, 99.19%, 99.30%, and 99.14%, respectively.

Its pathology has not been fully clarified and therefore highly effective treatments have not been obtained yet. Almost all the current treatment options aim to alleviate only the symptoms and not to eliminate the disease itself. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the main therapeutic agents against AD, whereas oxidative stress and inflammation have been found to be of great significance for the development and progression of neurodegeneration. In this work, ethyl nipecotate (ethyl-piperidine-3-carboxylate), a heterocyclic carboxylic acid derivative, which acts as a GABA reuptake inhibitor and has been used in research for diseases involving GABAergic neurotransmission dysfunction, was amidated with various carboxylic acids bearing antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory properties (e.g., ferulic acid, sinapic acid, butylated hydroxycinnamic acid). Most of our compounds have significant antioxidant potency as lipid peroxidation inhibitors (IC50 as low as 20 \u03bc\u039c), as oxidative protein glycation inhibitors (inhibition up to 57%), and act as DPPH reducing agents. Moreover, our compounds are moderate LOX inhibitors (up to 33% at 100 \u03bc\u039c) and could reduce rat paw edema induced by carrageenan by up to 61%. Finally, some of them possessed inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (IC50 as low as to 47 \u03bc\u039c).

They exhibit diverse pharmacological potentials including radical scavenging, as well as neuroprotective, anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activities, owing to their diverse chemical scaffolds. Saponins consist of an aglycone part (non-sugar) and a glycone part (sugar) and have at least one glycosidic (C-O sugar bond) linkage present between the glycone and aglycone mostly at C-3. On the basis of the aglycone part, saponins are classified into triterpenoid glycosides, steroid glycosides and alkaloid glycosides. Saponins exhibit neuroprotective activities against various disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) including stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). They mediate their therapeutic effects by modulation of various pathological targets. This study highlights various neuroprotective mechanisms of saponins including free radical scavenging, modulation of neuroprotective signaling pathways, activation of neurotrophic factors, modulation of neurotransmitters, inhibition of BACE1 enzyme and tau hyper-phosphorylation. The study concludes that saponins have considerable efficacy against various pathological targets of neurological disorders, especially AD, and might be an important source of leads against neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Exposure to global warming can be dangerous for health and can lead to an increase in the prevalence of neurological diseases worldwide. Such an effect is more evident in populations that are less prepared to cope with enhanced environmental temperatures. In this work, we extend our previous research on the link between climate change and Parkinson's disease (PD) to also include Alzheimer's Disease and other Dementias (AD/D) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Motor Neuron Diseases (ALS/MND). One hundred and eighty-four world countries were clustered into four groups according to their climate indices (warming and annual average temperature). Variations between 1990 and 2016 in the diseases' indices (prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years) and climate indices for the four clusters were analyzed. Unlike our previous work on PD, we did not find any significant correlation between warming and epidemiological indices for AD/D and ALS/MND patients. A significantly lower increment in prevalence in countries with higher temperatures was found for ALS/MND patients. It can be argued that the discordant findings between AD/D or ALS/MND and PD might be related to the different features of the neuronal types involved and the pathophysiology of thermoregulation. The neurons of AD/D and ALS/MND patients are less vulnerable to heat-related degeneration effects than PD patients. PD patients' substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which are constitutively frailer due to their morphology and function, fall down under an overwhelming oxidative stress caused by climate warming.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The identification of basic emotions plays an important role in social relationships and behaviors linked to survival. In neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the ability to recognize emotions may already be impaired at early stages of the disease, such as the stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). However, as regards vascular pathologies related to cognitive impairment, very little is known about emotion recognition in people bearing vascular risk factors (VRF). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine emotion recognition ability in the health continuum \"healthy advancing age-advancing age with VRF-MCI\". The sample consisted of 106 adults divided in three diagnostic groups; 43 adults with MCI, 41 adults bearing one or more VRF, and 22 healthy controls of advancing age (HC). Since HC were more educated and younger than the other two groups, the age-group and level of educational were taken into account in the statistical analyses. A dynamic visual test was administered to examine recognition of basic emotions and emotionally neutral conditions. The results showed only a significant diagnostic group x educational level interaction as regards total emotion recognition ability, F (4, 28.910) = 4.117 p = 0.004 \u03b72 = 0.166. High educational level seems to contribute to a high-level-emotion-recognition-performance both in healthy adults of advancing age and in adults bearing vascular risk factors. Medium educational level appears to play the same role only in healthy adults. Neither educational level can help MCI people to enhance their significantly lower emotion recognition ability.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome, which combines subjective memory complaint (SMC) and slower gait speed, is a newly-described predementia stage. Based on the involvement of vitamin D in the biology of both gait and cognition, we hypothesized that nondemented individuals with MCR would exhibit hypovitaminosis D more often compared to Cognitively Healthy Individuals (CHI). The objective of this cross-sectional analysis was to determine whether hypovitaminosis D was associated with MCR.Participants without dementia from the GAIT (Gait and Alzheimer Interactions Tracking) cohort study were classified into MCR or Cognitively Healthy Individuals (CHI) groups. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as the lowest quartile of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration compared to the other three combined. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) score, the Mini-Mental Short Examination (MMSE) score, education level, use of psychoactive drugs, and the number of chronic diseases were used as covariates.Among 244 nondemented and nonMCInonMCR participants from the GAIT cohort (mean age 71.4 \u00b1 3.7 years, 40.6% women), 66 participants were classified as MCR (36.9%) and 178 as CHI (63.1%). The lowest quartile of 25OHD concentration was directly associated with MCR (unadjusted OR = 2.85, p = 0.003) even after adjustment for studied potential confounders (fully adjusted OR = 2.61, p = 0.025). The BMI (adjusted OR = 6.65, p &lt; 0.001), MMSE score (adjusted OR = 0.74, p = 0.009), FAB score (adjusted OR = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001), number of chronic diseases (adjusted OR = 1.29, p = 0.043) and use of psychoactive drugs (adjusted OR = 2.55, p = 0.044) were also associated with MCR.Hypovitaminosis D was associated with MCR in older community-dwellers without dementia.",

Aberrant remodeling of microvesselsis associated with blood-brain barrier breakdown, development of neuroinflammation, inadequate microcirculation in active brain regions, and leads to the dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and progressive neurological deficits. In this review, we summarize current data on the mechanisms of blood vessel regression and pruning in brain plasticity and in Alzheimer's-type neurodegeneration.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are microbiome-derived glycolipids that are among the most potent pro-inflammatory neurotoxins known. In Homo sapiens, the major sources of LPSs are gastrointestinal (GI)-tract-resident facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, including Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli. LPSs have been abundantly detected in aged human brain by multiple independent research investigators, and an increased abundance of LPSs around and within Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected neurons has been found. Microbiome-generated LPSs and other endotoxins cross GI-tract biophysiological barriers into the systemic circulation and across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, a pathological process that increases during aging and in vascular disorders, including 'leaky gut syndrome'. Further evidence indicates that LPSs up-regulate pro-inflammatory transcription factor complex NF-kB (p50/p65) and subsequently a set of NF-kB-sensitive microRNAs, including miRNA-30b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155. These up-regulated miRNAs in turn down-regulate a family of neurodegeneration-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, including the mRNA encoding the neuron-specific neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein. While NF-L has been reported to be up-regulated in peripheral biofluids in AD and other progressive and lethal pro-inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders, NF-L is significantly down-regulated within neocortical neurons, and this may account for neuronal atrophy, loss of axonal caliber and alterations in neuronal cell shape, modified synaptic architecture and network deficits in neuronal signaling capacity. This paper reviews and reveals the most current findings on the neurotoxic aspects of LPSs and how these pro-inflammatory glycolipids contribute to the biological mechanism of progressive, age-related and ultimately lethal neurodegenerative disorders. This recently discovered gut-microbiota-derived LPS-NF-kB-miRNA-30b-NF-L pathological signaling network: (i) underscores a direct positive pathological link between the LPSs of GI-tract microbes and the inflammatory neuropathology, disordered cytoskeleton, and disrupted synaptic-signaling of the AD brain and stressed human brain cells in primary culture; and (ii) is the first example of a microbiome-derived neurotoxic glycolipid having significant detrimental miRNA-mediated actions on the expression of NF-L, an abundant filamentous protein known to be important in the maintenance of neuronal and synaptic homeostasis.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Physical exercise improves memory and cognition in physiological aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that A\u03b2 oligomer accumulation, neuroinflammation, and glial cell activation may lead to disruption of synaptic transmission in the prefrontal cortex of 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD Mice, resulting in impairment of learning and memory. On the other hand, treadmill exercise could prevent the pathogenesis and exert neuroprotective effects. Here, we used immunohistochemistry, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and slice electrophysiology to analyze the levels of GSK3\u03b2, A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2 dimers and trimers), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1), the phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Thr514, and synaptic currents in pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex. We show that 12-week treadmill exercise beginning in three-month-old mice led to the inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 kinase activity, decreases in the levels of A\u03b2 oligomers, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1), and the phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Thr514, reduction of microglial and astrocyte activation, and improvement of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD Mice. Thus, treadmill exercise reduces neuroinflammation, glial cell activation and improves synaptic transmission in the prefrontal cortex in 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD mice, possibly related to the inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 kinase activity.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and has been associated with changes in lipoprotein metabolism. We performed quantitative lipoprotein analysis in a local cohort of cognitively impaired elderly and control subjects using standardized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A commercially available quantitative NMR-based assay covering 112 lipoprotein main and subtype variables was used to investigate blood serum samples from a moderate cohort size of 161 persons (71 female, 90 male), including measures of quality control. Additionally, clinical metadata and cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers were collected and used for analysis. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) HDL-4 subfraction levels were mostly high in female individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by AD. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) LDL-2 cholesterol was slightly elevated in male AD patients. HDL-2 apolipoprotein Apo-A1, HDL-2 phospholipids, and HDL-3 triglycerides were highly abundant in AD and MCI women compared to men. When considering clinical biomarkers (A\u03b2, tau), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) VLDL-1 and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) triglycerides were substantially higher in AD compared to MCI. In addition, triglyceride levels correlated positively with dementia. Different lipoprotein serum patterns were identified for AD, MCI, and control subjects. Interestingly, HDL-4 and LDL-2 cholesterol parameters revealed strong gender-specific changes in the context of AD-driven dementia. As gender-based comparisons were based on smaller sub-groups with a low n-number, several statistical findings did not meet the significance threshold for multiple comparisons testing. Still, our finding suggests that serum HDL-4 parameters and various triglycerides correlate positively with AD pathology which could be a read-out of extended lipids traveling through the blood-brain barrier, supporting amyloid plaque formation processes. Thereof, we see herein a proof of concept that this quantitative NMR-based lipoprotein assay can generate important and highly interesting data for refined AD diagnosis and patient stratification, especially when larger cohorts are available.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive form of dementia, is characterized by the increased expression of secreted phospholipase A2 group IIA (GIIA) in the affected tissue and the dysfunction of neuronal mitochondria, similar to that induced by an orthologous GIIA from snake venom, \u03b2-neurotoxic ammodytoxin (Atx), in the motor neurons. To advance our knowledge about the role of GIIA in AD, we studied the effect of rat GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria and compared it with that of the Atx. We produced recombinant rat GIIA (rGIIA) and its enzymatically inactive mutant, rGIIA(D49S), and demonstrated that they interact with the subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (CCOX-II) as Atx. rGIIA and rGIIA(D49S) bound to this essential constituent of the respiratory chain complex with an approximately 100-fold lower affinity than Atx; nevertheless, both rGIIA molecules potently inhibited the CCOX activity in the isolated rat mitochondria. Like Atx, rGIIA was able to reach the mitochondria in the PC12 cells from the extracellular space, independent of its enzymatic activity. Consistently, the inhibition of the CCOX activity in the intact PC12 cells and in the rat's brain tissue sections was clearly demonstrated using rGIIA(D49S). Our results show that the effects of mammalian and snake venom \u03b2-neurotoxic GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria have similar molecular backgrounds. They suggest that the elevated extracellular concentration of GIIA in the AD tissue drives the translocation of this enzyme into local neurons and their mitochondria to inhibit the activity of the CCOX in the respiratory chain. Consequently, the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the neurons is attenuated, eventually leading to their degeneration. Atx was thus revealed as a valuable molecular tool for further investigations of the role of GIIA in AD.",

Clinically, the development of AD and obesity are known to be correlated. In this study, we analyzed the changes in AD pathological characteristics in 5XFAD mice after obesity induction through a high-fat diet (HFD). Surprisingly, high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein AI (APOA-I) serum levels were increased without low-density lipoprotein alteration in both HFD groups. The reactivity of astrocytes and microglia in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and fornix of the hypothalamus in 5XFAD mice was decreased in the transgenic (TG)-HFD high group. Finally, the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus was also significantly decreased in the TG-HFD high group. These results suggest that increased high-density lipoprotein level, especially with increased APOA-I serum level, alleviates the pathological features of AD and could be a new potential therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.",

In human astrocytoma cells, PCSK9 reduced cholesterol content (-20%; p &lt; 0.05), with a greater effect in presence of beta amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) (-37%; p &lt; 0.01). PCSK9 increased cholesterol synthesis and reduced the uptake of apoE-HDL-derived cholesterol (-36%; p &lt; 0.0001), as well as the LDL receptor (LDLR) and the apoE receptor 2 (ApoER2) expression (-66% and -31%, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). PCSK9 did not modulate ABCA1- and ABCG1-cholesterol efflux, ABCA1 levels, or membrane cholesterol. Conversely, ABCA1 expression and activity, as well as membrane cholesterol, were reduced by A\u03b2 (p &lt; 0.05). In human neuronal cells, PCSK9 reduced apoE-HDL-derived cholesterol uptake (-41%; p &lt; 0.001) and LDLR/apoER2 expression (p &lt; 0.05).

        "ArticleAbstract": "E2F4 was initially described as a transcription factor with a key function in the regulation of cell quiescence. Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have established that E2F4 can also play a relevant role in cell and tissue homeostasis, as well as tissue regeneration. For these non-canonical functions, E2F4 can also act in the cytoplasm, where it is able to interact with many homeostatic and synaptic regulators. Since E2F4 is expressed in the nervous system, it may fulfill a crucial role in brain function and homeostasis, being a promising multifactorial target for neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging. The regulation of E2F4 is complex, as it can be chemically modified through acetylation, from which we present evidence in the brain, as well as methylation, and phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of E2F4 within a conserved threonine motif induces cell cycle re-entry in neurons, while a dominant negative form of E2F4 (E2F4DN), in which the conserved threonines have been substituted by alanines, has been shown to act as a multifactorial therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We generated transgenic mice neuronally expressing E2F4DN. We have recently shown using this mouse strain that expression of E2F4DN in 5xFAD mice, a known murine model of AD, improved cognitive function, reduced neuronal tetraploidization, and induced a transcriptional program consistent with modulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide proteostasis and brain homeostasis recovery. 5xFAD/E2F4DN mice also showed reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 3-6 months of age. Here, we analyzed the immune response in 1 year-old 5xFAD/E2F4DN mice, concluding that reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis is maintained at this late stage. In addition, the expression of E2F4DN also reduced age-associated microgliosis in wild-type mice, thus stressing its role as a brain homeostatic agent. We conclude that E2F4DN transgenic mice represent a promising tool for the evaluation of E2F4 as a therapeutic target in neuropathology and brain aging.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Healthy brain functioning in mammals requires a continuous fine-tuning of gene expression. Accumulating evidence over the last three decades demonstrates that epigenetic mechanisms and dynamic changes in chromatin organization are critical components during the control of gene transcription in neural cells. Recent genome-wide analyses show that the regulation of brain genes requires the contribution of both promoter and long-distance enhancer elements, which must functionally interact with upregulated gene expression in response to physiological cues. Hence, a deep comprehension of the mechanisms mediating these enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) is critical if we are to understand the processes associated with learning, memory and recall. Moreover, the onset and progression of several neurodegenerative diseases and neurological alterations are found to be strongly associated with changes in the components that support and/or modulate the dynamics of these EPIs. Here, we overview relevant discoveries in the field supporting the role of the chromatin organization and of specific epigenetic mechanisms during the control of gene transcription in neural cells from healthy mice subjected to the fear conditioning paradigm, a relevant model to study memory ensemble. Additionally, special consideration is dedicated to revising recent results generated by investigators working with animal models and human postmortem brain tissue to address how changes in the epigenome and chromatin architecture contribute to transcriptional dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease, a widely studied neurodegenerative disease. We also discuss recent developments of potential new therapeutic strategies involving epigenetic editing and small chromatin-modifying molecules (or epidrugs).",

        "ArticleTitle": "The Flavonol Quercitrin Hinders GSK3 Activity and Potentiates the Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin Signaling Pathway.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway dictates cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Its deregulation is associated with many pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disease, frequently downregulated. The lack of efficient treatment for these diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), makes Wnt signaling an attractive target for therapies. Interestingly, novel Wnt signaling activating compounds are less frequently described than inhibitors, turning the quest for novel positive modulators even more appealing. In that sense, natural compounds are an outstanding source of potential drug leads. Here, we combine different experimental models, cell-based approaches, neuronal culture assays, and rodent behavior tests with Xenopus laevis phenotypic analysis to characterize quercitrin, a natural compound, as a novel Wnt signaling potentiator. We find that quercitrin potentiates the signaling in a concentration-dependent manner and increases the occurrence of the Xenopus secondary axis phenotype mediated by Xwnt8 injection. Using a GSK3 biosensor, we describe that quercitrin impairs GSK3 activity and increases phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2 S9 levels. Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor downstream of GSK3, impairs the quercitrin-mediated effect. Next, we show that quercitrin potentiates the Wnt3a-synaptogenic effect in hippocampal neurons in culture, which is blocked by XAV939. Quercitrin treatment also rescues the hippocampal synapse loss induced by intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2O) in mice. Finally, quercitrin rescues A\u03b2O-mediated memory impairment, which is prevented by XAV939. Thus, our study uncovers a novel function for quercitrin as a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling potentiator, describes its mechanism of action, and opens new avenues for AD treatments.",

The underlying mechanism of AD has not been fully understood. At present there is no method to detect AD at its early stage. Recent studies indicate that mitochondria dysfunction is related to AD pathogenesis. Altered mitochondria functions are found in AD and influence both amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau pathology. Variations in mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) lead to a change in energy metabolism in the brain and contribute to AD. MtDNA can reflect the status of mitochondria and therefore play an essential role in AD. In this review, we summarize the changes in mtDNA and mtDNA mutations in AD patients and discuss the possibility of mtDNA being a biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD.",

In this paper, we investigated whether combining serum and plasma biomarkers with feature selection could improve prediction performance for AD. 150 D patients and 150 normal controls (NCs) were enrolled for a serum test, and 100 patients and 100 NCs were enrolled for the plasma test. Among these, 79 ADs and 65 NCs had serum and plasma samples in common. A 10 times repeated 5-fold cross-validation model and a feature selection method were used to overcome the overfitting problem when serum and plasma biomarkers were combined. First, we tested to see if simply adding serum and plasma biomarkers improved prediction performance but also caused overfitting. Then we employed a feature selection algorithm we developed to overcome the overfitting problem. Lastly, we tested the prediction performance in a 10 times repeated 5-fold cross validation model for training and testing sets. We found that the combined biomarkers improved AD prediction but also caused overfitting. A further feature selection based on the combination of serum and plasma biomarkers solved the problem and produced an even higher prediction performance than either serum or plasma biomarkers on their own. The combined feature-selected serum-plasma biomarkers may have critical implications for understanding the pathophysiology of AD and for developing preventative treatments.",

All patients received brain 18F-FDG PET/CT according to the international guidelines, and images were analyzed both Qualitatively (QL) and Quantitatively (QN), the latter by a fully automated post-processing software that produced a z score metabolic map of 25 anatomically different cortical regions. A subset of n = 122 cases with a confirmed diagnosis of AD (n = 53) or MDI (n = 69) by 18-24-month clinical follow-up was finally included in the study. Univariate analysis and three automated classification models (classification tree -ClT-, ridge classifier -RC- and linear Support Vector Machine -lSVM-) were considered to estimate the ability of the z scores to discriminate between AD and MCI cases in.The univariate analysis returned 14 areas where the z scores were significantly different between AD and MCI groups, and the classification accuracy ranged between 74.59% and 76.23%, with ClT and RC providing the best results. The best classification strategy consisted of one single split with a cut-off value of \u2248 -2.0 on the z score from temporal lateral left area: cases below this threshold were classified as AD and those above the threshold as MCI.Our findings confirm the usefulness of brain 18F-FDG PET/CT QL and QN analyses in differentiating AD from MCI. Moreover, the combined use of automated classifications models can improve the diagnostic process since its use allows identification of a specific hypometabolic area involved in AD cases in respect to MCI. This data improves the traditional 18F-FDG PET/CT image interpretation and the diagnostic assessment of cognitive disorders.",

Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is an important target for the treatment of AD. In this study, machine learning approaches were applied to investigate the identification model of MAO-B inhibitors. The results showed that the identification model for MAO-B inhibitors with\u3000K-nearest neighbor(KNN) algorithm had a prediction accuracy of 94.1% and 88.0% for the 10-fold cross-validation test and the independent test set, respectively. Secondly, a quantitative activity prediction model for MAO-B was investigated with the Topomer CoMFA model. Two separate cutting mode approaches were used to predict the activity of MAO-B inhibitors. The results showed that the cut model with q2 = 0.612 (cross-validated correlation coefficient) and r2 = 0.824 (non-cross-validated correlation coefficient) were determined for the training and test sets, respectively. In addition, molecular docking was employed to analyze the interaction between MAO-B and inhibitors. Finally, based on our proposed prediction model, 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)propan-1-one (LB) was predicted as a potential MAO-B inhibitor and was validated by a multi-spectroscopic approach including fluorescence spectra and ultraviolet spectrophotometry.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "There is compelling evidence that head injury is a significant environmental risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) accelerates the onset of AD. Amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and tau aggregates have been observed in the post-mortem brains of TBI patients; however, the mechanisms leading to AD neuropathology in TBI are still unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that focal TBI induces changes in miRNA expression in and around affected areas, resulting in the altered expression of genes involved in neurodegeneration and AD pathology. For this purpose, we performed a miRNA array in extracts from rats subjected to experimental TBI, using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. In and around the contusion, we observed alterations of miRNAs associated with dementia/AD, compared to the contralateral side. Specifically, the expression of miR-9 was significantly upregulated, while miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-106b, miR-181a and miR-107 were downregulated. Via qPCR, we confirmed these results in an additional group of injured rats when compared to na\u00efve animals. Interestingly, the changes in those miRNAs were concomitant with alterations in the gene expression of mRNAs involved in amyloid generation and tau pathology, such as \u03b2-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and Glycogen synthase-3-\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2). In addition increased levels of neuroinflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1), glial activation, neuronal loss, and tau phosphorylation were observed in pericontusional areas. Therefore, our results suggest that the secondary injury cascade in TBI affects miRNAs regulating the expression of genes involved in AD dementia.",

Some proteins, including clusterin (CLU or apolipoprotein J) transporter, can be linked to AD, causing oxidative stress. Therefore, its activity can affect various functions involving complement system inactivation, lipid transport, chaperone activity, neuronal transmission, and cellular survival pathways. This transporter is known to bind to the amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide, which is the major pathogenic factor of AD. On the other hand, this transporter is also active at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a barrier that prevents harmful substances from entering and exiting the brain. Therefore, in this review, we discuss and emphasize the role of the CLU transporter and CLU-linked molecular mechanisms at the BBB interface in the pathogenesis of AD.",

A deficit in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity are considered the early pathological features associated with neurofibrillary tau and amyloid \u03b2 pathologies and neuroinflammation. The imbalance of neurotrophic factors with an increase in FGF-2 level and a decrease in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 4 (NT-4) in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and parietal cortex and disruption of the brain micro-environment are other characteristics of AD. Neurotrophic factors are crucial in neuronal differentiation, maturation, and survival.

In the present review we mainly focus on the major etiopathology features of AD and the use of a small neurotrophic and neurogenic peptide mimetic compound; P021 that was discovered in our laboratory and was found to overcome the difficulties faced in the administration of the whole neurotrophic factor proteins. We describe pre-clinical studies on P021 and its potential as a therapeutic drug for AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

Statins are one of the main cornerstone drugs for the management of cardiovascular disorders regardless of dyslipidemia status. Increasing the use of statins, mainly in the elderly groups for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, may affect their cognitive functions. Extensive and prolonged use of statins may affect cognitive functions in healthy subjects and dementia patients. Statins-induced cognitive impairments in both patients and health providers had been reported according to the post-marketing survey. This survey depends mainly on sporadic cases, and no cognitive measures were used. Evidence from prospective and observational studies gives no robust conclusion regarding the beneficial or detrimental effects of statins on cognitive functions in AD patients.

ONS cells expressed markers of neuroglial differentiation, providing a unique cellular model to explore changes of early AD-associated pathways. Our transcriptomics data from ONS cells revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cognitive processes in AD cells compared to MCI, or matched healthy controls (HC). A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 6 (AKAP6) was the most significantly altered gene in AD compared to both MCI and HC, and has been linked to cognitive function. The greatest change in gene expression of all DEGs occurred between AD and MCI. Gene pathway analysis revealed defects in multiple cellular processes with aging, intellectual deficiency and alternative splicing being the most significantly dysregulated in AD ONS cells. Our results demonstrate that ONS cells can provide a cellular model for AD that recapitulates disease-associated differences.

Meanwhile, the neurotrophic factor hypothesis has also been proposed for decades. Accumulating evidence states that the amyloidogenic process and neurotrophic dysfunction are mutually influenced and may coincidently cause the onset and progress of AD. Meanwhile, there are intracellular regulators participating both in the amyloidogenic process and neurotrophic pathways, which might be the common original causes of amyloidogenesis and neurotrophic dysfunction. In this review, the current understanding regarding the role of neurotrophic dysfunction and the amyloidogenic process in AD pathology is briefly summarized. The mutual influence of these two pathogenesis pathways and their potential common causal pathway are further discussed.

The most convincing biomarkers in the blood for AD are currently \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and Tau protein because amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are pathological hallmarks in the brains of patients with AD. The development of assay technologies in diagnosing early-stage AD is very important. The study of human AD subjects is hindered by ethical and technical limitations. Thus, many studies have therefore turned to AD animal models, such as Drosophila melanogaster, to explore AD pathology. However, AD biomarkers such as A\u03b2 and p-Tau protein in Drosophilamelanogaster occur at extremely low levels and are difficult to detect precisely. In this study, we applied the immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) technology of nanoparticles for the detection of p-Tau expressions in hTauR406W flies, an AD Drosophila model. Furthermore, we used IMR technology as a biosensor in the therapeutic evaluation of Chinese herbal medicines in hTauR406W flies with Tau-induced toxicity. To uncover the pathogenic pathway and identify therapeutic interventions of Chinese herbal medicines in Tau-induced toxicity, we modeled tauopathy in the notum of hTauR406W flies. Our IMR data showed that the selected Chinese herbal medicines can significantly reduce p-Tau expressions in hTauR406W flies.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Early detection of cis phosphorylated tau (cis P-tau) may help as an effective treatment to control the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we introduced for the first time a monoclonal antibody (mAb) with high affinity against cis P-tau. In this study, the cis P-tau mAb was utilized to develop a label-free immunosensor. The antibody was immobilized onto a gold electrode and the electrochemical responses to the analyte were acquired by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The immunosensor was capable of selective detection of cis P-tau among non-specific targets like trans P-tau and major plasma proteins. A wide concentration range (10 \u00d7 10-14 M-3.0 \u00d7 10-9 M) of cis P-tau was measured in PBS and human serum matrices with a limit of detection of 0.02 and 0.05 pM, respectively. Clinical applicability of the immunosensor was suggested by its long-term storage stability and successful detection of cis P-tau in real samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum collected from human patients at different stages of AD. These results suggest that this simple immunosensor may find great application in clinical settings for early detection of AD which is an unmet urgent need in today's healthcare services.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "In Alzheimer's disease, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by the deposition of amyloid-beta oligomers (A\u03b2Os), which represent one of the important causes of neuronal cell death. Additionally, A\u03b2Os are known to induce autophagy via ROS induction. Previous studies have shown that autophagy upregulation aggravates neuronal cell death. In this study, the effects of peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), a member of the peroxidase family of antioxidant enzymes, on regulating A\u03b2O-mediated autophagy were investigated. Prx2 decreased A\u03b2O-mediated oxidative stress and autophagy in N2a-APPswe cells. Further, we examined the relationship between the neuronal protective effect of Prx2 and a decrease in autophagy. Similar to the effects of N-acetyl cysteine, Prx2 decreased A\u03b2O-induced ROS and inhibited p62 protein expression levels by downregulating the activation of NRF2 and its translocation to the nucleus. In addition, treatment with 3-methyladenine, an autophagy inhibitor, ameliorates neuronal cell death. Overall, these results demonstrate that the Prx2-induced decrease in autophagy was associated with the inhibition of ROS via the ROS-NRF2-p62 pathway in N2a-APPswe cells. Therefore, our results revealed that Prx2 is a potential therapeutic target in anti-Alzheimer therapy.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of dementia associated with short-term memory loss and impaired cognition and, worldwide, it is a growing health issue. A number of therapeutic strategies have been studied to design and develop an effective anti-Alzheimer drug. Curcumin has a wide spectrum of biological properties. In this regard, the antioxidant potentials of mono-carbonyl curcumin analogues (h1-h5) were investigated using in vitro antioxidant assays and hippocampal-based in vivo mouse models such as light-dark box, hole board, and Y-maze tests. In the in vitro assay, mono-carbonyl curcumin analogues h2 and h3 with methoxy and chloro-substituents, respectively, showed promising 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonate (ABTS) free radical scavenging activities. In the in vivo studies, scopolamine administration significantly (p &lt; 0.001) induced oxidative stress and memory impairment in mice, in comparison to the normal control group. The pretreatment with mono-carbonyl curcumin analogues, specifically h2 and h3, significantly decreased (123.71 \u00b1 15.23 s (p &lt; 0.001), n = 8; 156.53 \u00b1 14.13 s (p &lt; 0.001), n = 8) the duration of time spent in the light chamber and significantly enhanced (253.95 \u00b1 19.05 s (p &lt; 0.001), n = 8, and 239.57 \u00b1 9.98 s (p &lt; 0.001), n = 8) the time spent in the dark compartment in the light-dark box arena. The numbers of hole pokings were significantly (p &lt; 0.001, n = 8) enhanced in the hole board test and substantially increased the percent spontaneous alternation performance (SAP %) in the Y-maze mouse models in comparison to the stress control group. In the biomarker analysis, the significant reduction in the lipid peroxidation (MDA) level and enhanced catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH) activities in the brain hippocampus reveal their antioxidant and memory enhancing potentials. However, further research is needed to find out the appropriate mechanism of reducing oxidative stress in pathological models.",

However, studies on how BPSD differ between individuals living at home and those in institutional settings are lacking. We conducted a questionnaire survey among healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in dementia care and nursing to clarify the characteristics of BPSD by residence status in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) living at home or in facilities.We sent questionnaires to HCPs and asked them to answer questions on up to five cases that needed treatment for BPSD and who received long-term care insurance services from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. Responses were received for 371 cases, of which 130 diagnosed with AD were analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with AD living at home (home care group) and patients with AD living in facilities (facility care group). A Chi-square test was used to identify differences between the two groups. A binomial logistic regression analysis was also conducted to clarify the association between residence status and BPSD.Of the 130 patients, 72 lived at home (home care group) and 58 resided in facilities (facility care group). None of the background factors was significantly different between the two groups. The Chi-square test indicated that sleep disturbance was significantly more common in the facility care group (60.3% in the facility care group vs. 33.3% in the home care group, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), while the logistic regression analysis indicated that sleep disturbance was significantly associated with residence status (odds ratio: 2.529, P\u00a0=\u00a00.038).Sleep disturbances were more frequently observed among patients with AD living in institutions than among those living in their homes.",

However, it is impossible to perform stein examinations in clinical practice. Assays of biomarkers in plasma would be convenient. It would be better to investigate the combinations of various biomarkers in AD, PD and FTD. Ninety-one subjects without neurodegenerative diseases, 76 patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or AD dementia, combined as AD family, were enrolled. One hundred and nine PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) or dementia (PDD), combined as PD family, were enrolled.

The results show that A\u03b2s and T-Tau are major domains in AD family. \u03b1-synuclein is highly dominant in PD family. FTD is closely associated with TDP-43 and T-Tau. The dominant plasma biomarkers in AD family, PD family and FTD are consistent with pathology.

We investigated longitudinal brain atrophy rates in the presymptomatic stage of genetic FTD, using normative brain volumetry software.Presymptomatic GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72 pathogenic variant carriers underwent longitudinal volumetric T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain as part of a prospective cohort study. Images were automatically analyzed with Quantib\u00ae ND which consisted of volume measurements (CSF and sum of gray and white matter) of lobes, cerebellum, and hippocampus. All volumes were compared to reference centile curves based on a large population-derived sample of non-demented individuals (n=4951). Mixed-effects models were fitted to analyze atrophy rates of the different gene groups as a function of age.34 GRN, eight MAPT, and 14 C9orf72 pathogenic variant carriers were included (mean age=52.1, standard deviation=7.2; 66% female). Mean follow-up duration of the study was 64\u00b133 months (median=52; range 13-108). GRN pathogenic variant carriers showed faster decline than the reference centile curves for all brain areas, though relative volumes remained between 5th and 75th percentile between the ages of 45-70. In MAPT pathogenic variant carriers, frontal lobe volume was already at the 5th percentile at age 45, and showed further decline between the ages 50-60. Temporal lobe volume started in the 50th percentile at age 45, but showed fastest decline over time compared to other brain structures. Frontal, temporal, parietal and cerebellar volume already started below the 5th percentile compared to the reference centile curves at age 45 for C9orf72 pathogenic variant carriers, but there was minimal decline over time until the age of 60.We provide evidence for longitudinal brain atrophy in the presymptomatic stage of genetic FTD. The affected brain areas and the age after which atrophy rates start to accelerate and diverge from normal aging slopes differed between gene groups. These results highlight the value of normative volumetry software for disease-tracking and staging biomarkers in genetic FTD. These techniques could help in identifying the optimal time window for starting treatment and monitoring treatment response.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Kainate receptors (KARs) form a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors which regulate the activity of neuronal networks by both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms. Their implication in pathologies is well documented for epilepsy. The higher prevalence of epileptic symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients questions the role of KARs in AD. Here we investigated whether the synaptic expression and function of KARs was impaired in mouse models of AD. We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude and decay time of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (male and female APP/PS1 mice) of AD. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was observed in CA3 pyramidal cells in male and female mice with a genetic deletion of either presenilin or APP/APLP2 as well as in organotypic cultures treated with \u03b3-secretase inhibitors. Finally, the GluK2 protein interacts with full-length and C-terminal fragments of APP. Overall, our data suggest that APP stabilizes KARs at synapses, possibly through a trans-synaptic mechanism, and this interaction is under the control the \u03b3-secretase proteolytic activity of presenilin.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:Synaptic impairment correlates strongly with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, many studies have addressed the dysregulation of AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). Kainate receptors (KARs) which form the third family of iGluRs, represent an underestimated actor in the regulation of neuronal circuits and have not yet been examined in the context of AD. Here we provide evidence that synaptic KARs are markedly impaired in a mouse model of AD. Further experiments indicate that the gamma-secretase activity of presenilin acting on the Amyloid Precursor Protein controls synaptic expression of KAR. This study clearly indicates that KARs should be taken into consideration whenever addressing synaptic dysfunction and related cognitive deficits in the context of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Previous studies have shown that the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert and its white matter projections are affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it is still unknown if these alterations can be found in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and whether they are more pronounced than changes found in conventional brain volumetric measurements. To address these questions, we investigated microstructural alterations of two major cholinergic pathways in individuals along the AD continuum using an in vivo model of the human cholinergic system based on neuroimaging. We included 405 participants (53 AD, 66 MCI, 174 SCD, and 112 healthy controls) from the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE). We modelled the cholinergic white matter pathways with an enhanced diffusion neuroimaging pipeline that included probabilistic fiber-tracking methods and prior anatomical knowledge. The integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was compared between stages of the AD continuum, in the whole cohort and in a CSF amyloid-beta stratified subsample. The discriminative power of the integrity of the pathways was compared to the conventional volumetric measures of hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. A multivariate model was employed to investigate the role of these pathways in relation to cognitive performance. We found that the integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was significantly reduced in all stages of the AD continuum, including individuals with SCD. The differences involved posterior cholinergic white matter in the SCD stage and extended to anterior frontal white matter in MCI and AD dementia stages. Both cholinergic pathways and conventional volumetric measures showed higher predictive power in the more advanced stages of the disease, i.e., MCI and AD dementia. In contrast, the integrity of cholinergic pathways was more informative in distinguishing SCD from healthy controls, as compared with the volumetric measures. The multivariate model revealed a moderate contribution of the cholinergic white matter pathways but not of volumetric measures towards memory tests in the SCD and MCI stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cholinergic white matter pathways are altered already in SCD individuals, preceding the more widespread alterations found in MCI and AD. The integrity of the cholinergic pathways identified the early stages of AD better than conventional volumetric measures such as hippocampal volume or volume of cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert.",

Herein, using a spatially patterned antibody barcode microchip, we realized the mapping of 12 different secretomes, covering cytokines, neurotrophic factors (NFs), and neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) from high-throughput, paired single cells (\u2265 600) simultaneously under normal conditions and an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model induced with amyloid beta protein 1-42 (A\u03b21-42). We applied the platform to analyze the secretion profiles from paired neuron-macrophage and neuron-microglia single cells with human cell lines. We found that pairwise neuron-macrophage interaction would trigger immune responses and attenuate neuron cells' secretion, while neuron-microglia interaction generally results in opposite outcomes in secretion. When neuron cells are induced with A\u03b21-42 protein into the AD model, both neuron-macrophage and neuron-microglia interactions lead to increased cytokines and NDEs and decreased NFs. Further analysis of AD patients' serum showed that NDEs were significantly higher in patients' samples than in the control group, validating our observation from the interaction assay. Furthermore, we resolved previously undifferentiated heterogeneity underlying the secretions from single-neuron cells. We found that the NDE and NF secretion was less dependent on the paracrine signaling between one another and that secretions from neuron cells would attenuate after differentiation with A\u03b21-42. This study demonstrates the mapping of the different secretomes from paired neuron-immune single cells, providing avenues for understanding how neurons and immune cells interact through the complex secretome network.",

This study included cognitively intact participants aged 60 to 90 years at baseline with annual follow-up from October 1997 to December 2020 (maximum follow-up of 22 years). During the follow-up, participants underwent brain autopsies. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to February 2022 using mixed-effect models.BMI was calculated using height and weight measured at baseline and follow-ups.Incident MCI and dementia were diagnosed following standard criteria. Neuropathological assessments (including global Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology) were performed for autopsies.A total of 1390 participants (mean [SD] age, 78.4 [6.5] years; 1063 female [76.5%]) were included in the study. In the analysis of BMI trajectories before MCI (n = 939), during the follow-up (median [IQR] duration, 6 [3-9] years), 371 participants (39.5%) developed MCI, of whom 88 (23.7%) progressed to dementia. Those who developed MCI were older (mean [SD] age, 79.6 [5.9] years vs 76.9 [6.6] years), consumed less alcohol (median [IQR] consumption, 0 [0-5.8] g/day vs 1.1 [0-6.9] g/day), had a lower BMI (mean [SD], 27.2 [4.9] vs 28.2 [5.9]), and were more likely to be apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers (89 of 371 [24.0%] vs 98 of 568 [17.3%]) compared with those who remained cognitively intact over follow-up. Those who developed dementia were older (mean [SD] age, 81.0 [5.2] years vs 79.1 [6.0] years), had a lower level of physical activity (median [IQR] activity, 1.0 [0-2.5] h/week vs 1.8 [0.2-3.8] h/week), and were more likely to be APOE \u03b54 carriers than those who were dementia-free (33 of 88 [37.5%] vs 56 of 283 [19.8%]). Compared with participants who remained cognitively intact, in those with incident MCI, BMI tended to decline earlier and faster. From 7 years before diagnosis, people with incident MCI had an associated significantly lower BMI (mean difference, -0.96; 95% CI, -1.85 to -0.07) than those who were cognitively intact. Among people with incident MCI, the slopes of BMI decline did not differ significantly between those who did and did not develop dementia (\u03b2, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.21 to 0.15). In the analysis of BMI trajectories before autopsy (n = 358), BMI was associated with a faster declination among participants with a high burden of global Alzheimer disease pathology (\u03b2 for pathology\u2009\u00d7\u2009time highest vs lowest tertile, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.02) or vascular pathology (\u03b2 for pathology\u2009\u00d7\u2009time2 highest vs lowest tertile, 0.02; 95% CI, 0-0.05).Results of this cohort study suggest that among cognitively intact people, significantly lower BMI occurs beginning approximately 7 years before MCI diagnosis. After MCI diagnosis, BMI declines at the same pace in people who develop dementia and those who do not. High brain pathologies may underly the BMI decline preceding dementing disorders.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neuroinflammation is a condition associated with several types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), mainly caused by an inflammatory response to amyloid peptides that induce microglial activation, with subsequent cytokine release. Neuronal caspase-1 from inflammasome and cathepsin B are key enzymes mediating neuroinflammation in AD, therefore, revealing new molecules to modulate these enzymes may be an interesting approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we searched for new caspase-1 and cathepsin B inhibitors from five species of Brazilian marine invertebrates (four cnidarians and one echinoderm). The results show that the extract of the box jellyfish Chiropsalmus quadrumanus inhibits caspase-1. This extract was fractionated, and the products monitored for their inhibitory activity, until the obtention of a pure molecule, which was identified as trigonelline by mass spectrometry. Moreover, four extracts inhibit cathepsin B, and Exaiptasia diaphana was selected for subsequent fractionation and characterization, resulting in the identification of betaine as being responsible for the inhibitory action. Both molecules are already found in marine organisms, however, this is the first study showing a potent inhibitory effect on caspase-1 and cathepsin B activities. Therefore, these new prototypes can be considered for the enzyme inhibition and subsequent control of the neuroinflammation.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Aging can cause morphological transformation in human microglia indicative of cell senescence, termed microglial dystrophy. However, cellular senescence is characterized by additional changes, such as an irregular cell cycle arrest, and a variety of metabolic and molecular changes including a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, dysfunction of degradation mechanisms, and altered DNA damage response. Here, we tested whether dystrophic microglia display customary markers of cell senescence by performing double and triple staining in sections of the temporal lobe and brain stem from 14 humans. We found that markers related to oxidative damage, such as upregulation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and y-H2AX, as well as inclusion of lipofuscin, do not or only exceptionally colocalize with dystrophic microglia. Further, we did not observe a decline in lamin B1 around nuclear laminae in either dystrophic or ramified microglia within the same microscopic field. Only ferritin expression, which is known to increase with aging in CNS microglia, was frequently observed in dystrophic, but rarely in ramified microglial cells. We conclude that neither dystrophic nor ramified microglia in human brain exhibit significant expression of conventional senescence markers associated with oxidative stress, and that ferritin is the dominant immunophenotypic change related to microglial aging. We suggest that multiple pathogenic mechanisms other than those driving cellular senescence contribute to dystrophic transformation of microglia.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Background PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors are important therapeutic options for reducing cardiovascular disease risk; however, questions remain regarding potential differences in the neuropsychiatric impact of long-term PCSK9 inhibition between men and women. Methods and Results Using PCSK9 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms from European ancestry-based genome-wide association studies of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (N=1\u2009320\u2009016), circulating PCSK9 protein levels (N=10\u2009186), tissue-specific PCSK9 gene expression, sex-specific genome-wide association studies of anxiety, depression, cognition, insomnia, and dementia (ranging from 54\u2009321 to 194\u2009174), we used drug-target inverse variance-weighted Mendelian randomization (MR) and complementary MR methods (MR Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode) to investigate potential neuropsychiatric consequences of genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition in men and women. We failed to find evidence surpassing correction for multiple comparisons of relationships between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and the risk for the 12 neuropsychiatric end points in either men or women. Drug-target analyses were generally well-powered to detect effect estimates at several hypothesized thresholds for both combined-sex and sex-specific end points, especially analyses using PCSK9 instruments derived from protein and expression quantitative trait loci. Further, MR estimates across complementary MR methods and additional models using genetic instruments derived from circulating PCSK9 protein levels and tissue-specific PCSK9 expression were in alignment, strengthening causal inference. Conclusions Genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition showed a neutral neuropsychiatric side effect profile with no major sex-specific differences. Given statistical power considerations, replication with larger samples, as well as data from other ancestral populations, are necessary. These findings may have important clinical implications for lipid-lowering drug-prescribing practices and side effect monitoring of approved and future PCSK9 therapies.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Amyloid beta 42 peptide (Abeta42) accumulation is a key characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and causes synaptic dysfunctions. To date, the effects of Abeta42 accumulation on GABAergic synapses are poorly understood Our findings suggest that, similarly to what observed on glutamatergic synapses, Abeta42 modifies GABAergic synapses by targeting ryanodine receptors and causing calcium dysregulation The GABAergic impairments can be restored by the RyR-calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 Based on our research, RyRs stabilization may represent a novel pharmaceutical strategy for preventing or delaying of AD.Oligomeric form of amyloid beta protein Abeta42 contributes to the development of synaptic abnormalities and cognitive impairments associated with AD. To date, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how Abeta42 alters the elementary parameters of GABAergic synaptic function. Here we found that Abeta42 increased the frequency and amplitude of miniature GABAergic currents as well as the amplitude of evoked inhibitory post synaptic currents (eIPSCs). When we focused on paired pulse depression (PPD) to establish whether GABA release probability (p) was affected by Abeta42, we did not observe any significant change. On the other hand, a more detailed investigation of the presynaptic effects induced by Abeta42 by means of multiple probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) and cumulative amplitude analysis shown an increased size of both the readily releasable pool responsible for synchronous release (RRPsyn ) and the number of release sites (N). We further explored whether ryanodine receptors (RyRs) contributed to exacerbate these changes by stabilizing the interaction between RyRs and the accessory protein calstabin. We observed that the RyRs calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 restored the synaptic parameters to values comparable to those measured in control conditions. In conclusion, our results clarify the mechanisms of potentiation of GABAergic synapses induced by Abeta42. We further suggest that RyRs are involved in the control of synaptic activity during the early stage of AD onset and that their stabilization could represent a new therapeutical approach for AD treatment. Abstract figure legend Left: pre- and postsynaptic neurons are represented under physiological conditions. At rest, ER membrane contains RyRs in closed state and the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous is shifted towards the asynchronous. Middle: Abeta42 causes calcium dysregulation by targeting RyRs which assume a leaky conformation. Abeta42 potentiates the synchronous release and increases the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous, leaving unaltered the size of RRP total. The number of release sites and the number of GABAergic receptors at the postsynaptic membrane are both increased by Abeta42. Right: S107, a RyCal compound, counteracts the effects induced by Abeta42 on GABAergic synapses by stabilizing RyRs in a close conformational configuration, recovering the size of RRP asynchronous and decreasing the number of release sites.

        "ArticleAbstract": "The \u03b54 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE \u03b54) is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with amyloid pathogenesis. However, it is not clear how APOE \u03b54 accelerates amyloid-beta\u00a0(A\u03b2) deposition during the seeding stage of amyloid development in AD patient neurons.AD patient induced neurons (iNs) with an APOE \u03b54 inducible system were prepared from skin fibroblasts of AD patients. Transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA isolated from the AD patient iNs expressing APOE \u03b54 at amyloid-seeding and amyloid-aggregation stages. Knockdown of IGFBP3 was applied in the iNs to investigate the role of IGFBP3 in the APOE \u03b54-mediated amyloidosis.We optimized amyloid seeding stage in the iNs of AD patients that transiently expressed APOE \u03b54. Remarkably, we demonstrated that A\u03b2\u00a0 pathology was aggravated by the induction of APOE \u03b54 gene expression at the amyloid early-seeding stage in the iNs of AD patients. Moreover, transcriptome analysis in the early-seeding stage revealed that IGFBP3 was functionally important in the molecular pathology of APOE \u03b54-associated AD.Our findings suggest that the presence of APOE \u03b54 at the early A\u03b2-seeding stage in patient iNs is critical for aggravation of sporadic AD pathology.

There is a present need for a single, cohesive model of myelin homeostasis in AD.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia\u00a0that affects memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms eventually become severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. Understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of AD is necessary for the development of strategies for AD prevention and/or treatment, and modeling of this pathology is an important step in achieving this goal. \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) injection is a widely used approach for modeling AD. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the model constructed by injection of A\u03b2 in combination with a prooxidant cocktail (ferrous sulfate, A\u03b2, and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (FAB)) best reflects the natural development of this disease. The relationship between oxidative stress and A\u03b2 deposition and their respective roles in A\u03b2-induced pathology in different animal models of AD have been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we compared the effects of A\u03b2 1-42 alone with that of A\u03b2-associated oxidative stress induced by the FAB cocktail on the neurodegeneration of hippocampal cells in vitro. We constructed a FAB-induced AD model using rat primary hippocampal cells and analyzed the contribution of each compound. The study mainly focused on the prooxidant aspects of AD pathogenesis. Moreover, cellular bioenergetics was assessed and routine metabolic tests were performed to determine the usefulness of this model. The data clearly show that aggregated A\u03b21-42 alone is significantly less toxic to hippocampal cells. Aggregated A\u03b2 damages neurons, and glial cells proliferate to remove A\u03b2 from the hippocampus. External prooxidant agents (Fe2+) or inhibition of internal antioxidant defense by BSO has more toxic effects on hippocampal cells than aggregated A\u03b2 alone. Moreover, hippocampal cells fight against A\u03b2-induced damage more effectively than against oxidative damage. However, the combination of A\u03b2 with external oxidative damage and inhibition of internal antioxidant defense is even more toxic, impairs cellular defense systems, and may mimic the late phase of AD-associated cell damage. Our findings strongly indicate a critical role for the combination of A\u03b2 and oxidative stress in the development of neurodegeneration in vitro.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "In Alzheimer's disease pathology, several neuronal processes are dysregulated by excitotoxicity including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (OS). New therapeutic agents capable of modulating such processes are needed to foster neuroprotection. Here, the effect of an optimised NMDA receptor antagonist, UB-ALT-EV and memantine, as a gold standard, have been evaluated in 5XFAD mice. Following treatment with UB-ALT-EV, nor memantine, changes in the calcineurin (CaN)/NFAT pathway were detected. UB-ALT-EV increased neurotropic factors (Bdnf, Vgf and Ngf) gene expression. Treatments reduced astrocytic and microglial reactivity as revealed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) quantification. Interestingly, only UB-ALT-EV was able to reduce gene expression of Trem2, a marker of microglial activation and NF-\u03baB. Pro-inflammatory cytokines Il-1\u03b2, Ifn-\u03b3, Ccl2 and Ccl3 were down-regulated in UB-ALT-EV-treated mice but not in memantine-treated mice. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory markers of the M2-migroglial phenotype, chitinase-like 3 (Ym1) and Arginase-1 (Arg1), were up-regulated after treatment with UB-ALT-EV. Since iNOS gene expression decreased after UB-ALT-EV treatment, a qPCR array containing 84 OS-related genes was performed. We found changes in Il-19, Il-22, Gpx6, Ncf1, Aox1 and Vim gene expression after UB-ALT-EV. Hence, our results reveal a robust effect on neuroinflammation and OS processes after UB-ALT-EV treatment, surpassing the memantine effect in 5XFAD.",

However, in our previous studies, the binary co-amorphous system of andrographolide-oxymatrine (AP-OMT) was found to have obvious recrystallization and poor dissolution behavior. Therefore, in this study, we designed three stable ternary co-amorphous systems to improve the physicochemical properties of the binary co-amorphous system of AP-OMT. The ternary co-amorphous systems were prepared with AP, OMT, and trans-cinnamic acid (CA), p-hydroxycinnamic acid (pHCA), or ferulic acid (FA). Intermolecular hydrogen bonds were confirmed by spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. Solubility studies showed that the solubility of the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA was significantly increased compared with that of crystalline AP. Dissolution experiments suggested that the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA exhibited better dissolution behavior without significant recrystallization compared to the binary co-amorphous AP-OMT. The stability study confirmed that the ternary co-amorphous system of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA maintained good physical stability in the long term for 18 months. In addition, pharmacological experiments revealed that the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA have an excellent safety profile and its anti-Alzheimer's disease effects are significantly improved compared to that of the binary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT. Moreover, this study also found that reducing the pKa value of low molecular weight co-formers would affect the intermolecular interactions and improve the solubility of drugs in the ternary co-amorphous systems. In conclusion, we have successfully prepared ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA by amorphization technique, which improves the physicochemical properties of the binary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT and anti-Alzheimer's disease activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans model. The mechanism for the influence of the pKa value of the co-formers on the physicochemical properties of the ternary co-amorphous system was preliminarily explored, providing theoretical guidance for the development of the ternary co-amorphous system.",

Previous studies on the prevalence of cSVD are mostly based on single geographically-defined cohorts in high-income countries. Studies investigating the prevalence of cSVD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are expanding but have not been systematically assessed.AimThis study aims to systematically review the prevalence of cSVD in LMICs.ResultsArticles were searched from the Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from 1st Jan 2000 to 31st March 2022, without language restrictions. Title/abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction were performed by 2-7 independent reviewers. The prevalence of cSVD and study sample size were extracted by pre-defined world regions and health status. The Risk of Bias for Non-randomized Studies tool was used. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022311133). A meta-analysis of proportion was performed to assess the prevalence of different MRI markers of cSVD and a meta-regression was performed to investigate associations between cSVD prevalence and type of study, age, and male: female ratio.Of 2,743 studies identified, 42 spanning 12 global regions were included in the systematic review. Most of the identified studies were from China (n=23). The median prevalence of moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities (WMH) was 20.5%, 40.5%, and 58.4% in the community, stroke, and dementia groups, respectively. The median prevalence of lacunes was 0.8% and 33.52% in the community and stroke groups. The mean prevalence of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) was 10.7% and 22.4% in the community and stroke groups. The mean prevalence of moderate-to-severe perivascular spaces was 25.0% in the community. Meta-regression analyses showed that the weighted median age (51.4 \u00b1 0.0 years old; range: 36.3-80.2) was a significant predictor of the prevalence of moderate-to-severe WMH and lacunes, while the type of study was a significant predictor of the prevalence of CMB. The heterogeneity of studies was high (> 95%). Male participants were overrepresented.ConclusionsThis systematic review and meta-analysis provide data on cSVD prevalence in LMICs and demonstrated the high prevalence of the condition. cSVD research in LMICs is being published at an increasing rate, especially between 2010-2022. More data is particularly needed from Sub-Saharan Africa & Central Europe, Eastern Europe & Central Asia.",

Compounds 9 (IC5075.14 \u00b1 1.82 \u00b5M), 13 (IC50=16.14 \u00b1 0.43 \u00b5M), were determined to be stronger BChE inhibitors than the reference galanthamine (IC50= 93.53 \u00b1 2.23 \u00b5M). The IC50 value of compound 16 for BChE inhibition (IC50=126.56 \u00b1 11.96 \u00b5M) was slightly higher than galantamine. The atomic interactions between the ligands and the key amino acids inside the binding cavities were simulated to determine their ligand-binding positions and free energies. The three inhibitory coumarins (9, 13, 16) were next tested for their effects on the genes associated with AD using human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line. Our data indicate that they could be considered for further evaluation as new anti-Alzheimer drug candidates.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease, seriously influencing the quality of life and is a global health problem. Many factors affect the onset and development of AD, but specific mechanisms underlying the disease are unclear. Most studies investigating AD have focused on neurons and the gray matter in the central nervous system (CNS) but have not led to effective treatments. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on the white matter (WM). Magnetic resonance imaging and pathology studies have shown different degrees of WM abnormality during the progression of AD. Myelin sheaths, the main component of WM in the CNS, wrap and insulate axons to ensure conduction of the rapid action potential and axonal integrity. WM damage is characterized by progressive degeneration of axons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and myelin in one or more areas of the CNS. The contributions of OLs to AD progression have, until recently, been largely overlooked. OLs are integral to myelin production, and the proliferation and differentiation of OLs, an early characteristic of AD, provide a promising target for preclinical diagnosis and treatment. However, despite some progress, the key mechanisms underlying the contributions of OLs to AD remain unclear. Given the heavy burden of medical treatment, a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD is vital. This review comprehensively summarize the results on WM abnormalities in AD and explores the relationship between OL progenitor cells and the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential future research directions are discussed.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most prominent neurodegenerative diseases. Results from animal and cellular models suggest that FAD-deficient forms of NQO1 may accelerate the aggregation of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide Ab1-42. Here we examined in-vitro whether NQO1 and its FAD-deficient P187S mutation (NQO1*2) directly interact with Ab1-42 and modify its rate of aggregation. When monitored using the fluorescence of either non-covalent thioflavin T or HiLyte Fluor 647 dye covalently attached to the Ab1-42 peptide, the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42 were markedly more rapid in the presence of NQO1*2 than the wild-type NQO1. Experiments using apo-NQO1 indicate that this increase is linked to the inability of NQO1*2 to bind to FAD. Furthermore, dicoumarol, an NQO1 inhibitor which binds near the FAD binding site and stabilizes NQO1*2, markedly decreased the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42. Imaging flow cytometry confirmed in-vitro co-aggregation of NQO1 isoforms and Ab1-42. Ab1-42 alone forms rod shaped fibril structures while in the presence of NQO1 isoforms, Ab1-42 is incorporated in the middle of larger globular protein aggregates surrounded by NQO1 molecules. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis indicates that Ab1-42 interacts with NQO1 isoforms with a specific stoichiometry through a hydrophobic interaction with positive enthalpy and entropy changes. These data define the kinetics, mechanism, and shape of co-aggregates of Ab1-42 and NQO1 isoforms and the potential relevance of FAD-deficient forms of NQO1 for amyloid aggregation diseases.",

One essential component of disease management in older adults with AD is the maintenance and improvement of QOL. The QOL-AD is a tool that can be administered to evaluate QOL in AD patients, but it can take too long to administer in a patient visit. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of a more brief, 6-item QOL questionnaire, LIFEAD, comparing it to the QOL-AD in older adults with mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction.Prospective validation study.Participants were patients presenting to internal medicine and geriatrics outpatient clinics and a nursing home.285 adults 65 and older with mild to moderate cognitive impairment.QOL was assessed using LIFEAD and the QOL-AD. Demographic data were collected and level of depression was determined through a demographic questionnaire and the PHQ-8, respectively.QOL-AD mean item scores ranged from 2.27-3.32 with an average scale total of 36.28 \u00b1 6.48. LIFEAD mean item scores ranged from 2.26-2.51 with an average scale total of 14.28 \u00b1 2.87. A majority (68%) of patients rated all items on LIFEAD as either average or good. The correlation between LIFEAD and the QOL-AD was 0.71 (p<0.001). Both LIFEAD and the QOL-AD showed strong internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.82 and 0.87, respectively.This study validated LIFEAD and exhibited LIFEAD can assess QOL in older adults with mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction in the clinic or nursing home. LIFEAD is a short, practical questionnaire and is easily administered in approximately 1 minute. Further research on LIFEAD could be done with larger samples, in different clinical populations, and including persons of other ethnic backgrounds.",

All participants in the open-label phase receive the 16 mg/day dose.Co-primary clinical outcomes are the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11) and the 23-item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL23). Secondary biomarker measures include whole-brain atrophy and temporal lobe 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.446 participants are expected to complete the 12-month placebo-controlled phase in March 2022.If the primary end points are met, the data will provide confirmatory evidence of the clinical and biomarker benefits of hydromethylthionine mesylate in minimal to moderate AD.

Recent studies reported intriguing biphasic trajectories of cortical structural changes in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), comprising decreased mean diffusivity (MD) and increased cortical thickness in cognitively normal amyloid-positive individuals, ahead of increases and decreases, respectively, in subsequent disease stages.To better understand the cytoarchitectural correlates of these observations, we assessed novel cortical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics that are correlated with disruption of cortical minicolumns and protein deposition.Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of whole brain and temporal lobe cortical diffusivity measures. Investigation of associations between baseline cortical diffusivity values and 24-month longitudinal structural-MRI changes. Investigations of the relationships between cortical diffusivity measures and biomarkers of neuroinflammation.Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).Twenty-four amyloid-negative controls (CN-), 28 amyloid-positive controls (CN+), 46 amyloid-positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI+) and 22 amyloid-positive subjects with AD were included.3DT1 and DTI scans at baseline and approximately 24-month follow-up were used to calculate cortical MD and three novel cortical diffusivity measures: the angle between the radial minicolumnar axis and the principal diffusion direction (AngleR); the diffusion components perpendicular to the minicolumns (PerpPD+), and the principal diffusion component parallel with the minicolumns (ParlPD). Cortical macrostructural measurements (cortical volume fraction and cortical thickness), were used to test the hypothesis that baseline cortical diffusivity values can predict change in structural MRI outcomes over approximately 24 months. CSF soluble TREM2 and progranulin (PGRN) concentrations were used to investigate associations with microglial activity and potentially other aspects of neuroinflammation.Cortical diffusivity metrics revealed a dependence on disease stage, with AngleR and PerpPD+ displaying biphasic relationships and ParlPD a monotonic relationship with clinical severity. The novel metrics were able to differentiate between Amyloid+ and Amyloid- controls (AngleR) and to differentiate among disease stages along the AD continuum (PerpPD+). Linear regression revealed significant associations between baseline cortical diffusivity values and subsequent 24-month longitudinal structural-MRI changes. AngleR values were significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 and PGRN concentrations.Cortical diffusivity parameters reflecting minicolumnar organization and neuroinflammation may provide a sensitive and biologically interpretable measurement of cortex quality and microstructure across the AD continuum.",

Healthcare costs were sourced from several German publications. Costs and life-years were discounted at 3% annually.Results are reported as lifetime incremental differences in total tax revenue and transfer payments between the cohort affected by Alzheimer's disease and their general population analogues.The Alzheimer's disease-affected pair was associated with net incremental fiscal losses of \u20ac74,288 ($85,037) to the German government and social security over the lifetime of people with Alzheimer's disease.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that \u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity and concentration in blood are candidate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Investigating potential demographic, biological, and clinical determinants of BACE1 in the blood matrix is the critical step to validate and qualify BACE1 bio-indicators for different contexts-of-use (CoU), such as risk assessment, early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, management of AD, and outcome of amyloid pathway targeted drugs.To evaluate the influence of age, sex, HDL-cholesterol and comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes) on circulating BACE-1 activity.prospective analysis of serum samples, clinical, biological, and demographic variables.Three cohorts: 1) Memory Clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine, S. Anna University Hospital, Ferrara (Italy); 2) outpatients attending the Menopause and Osteoporosis Centre (MOC) of the University of Ferrara (Ferrara, Italy); 3) Prevention Center of the University of Ferrara.504 cognitively healthy individuals (median age: 62 years, interquartile range: 51-73) and 175 patients with AD (78 years, 74-82).serum BACE1 (sBACE1), age, sex, HDL-cholesterol, major comorbidities.Age was the strongest independent predictor of sBACE1 variance (\u03b2=0.425, p<0.0001), followed by sex (\u03b2=0.180, p<0.0001), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (\u03b2=-0.168, p<0.0001) and hypertension (\u03b2=0.111, p<0.05) (overall model, R2: 0.232). The probability of having elevated sBACE1 activity increased after 70 years of age, with women being more susceptible to higher sBACE1 activity than men.We provide evidence about potential clinical and biological determinants of sBACE1 activity with a strong association among biomarker, female sex, and older age.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Mid-life obesity has been reported to be a significant risk factor for later-life dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been suggested to have an adverse effect while cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been suggested to have a protective effect on cognitive function of older adults. However, studies investigating such effects in middle-aged obese women are limited.To compare cognitive performances between obese and normal weight middle-aged women and examine the effects of MetS and CRF on cognitive performances when combined with obesity.Cross-sectional study with the data of 87 middle-aged women (58 obese and 29 normal weight, with age and education matched).The non-invasive screening method for metabolic syndrome (NIM-MetS) was used to detect MetS. CRF was determined by using maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and was classified as high or low (VO2 max higher or lower than 50th percentile) based on the American College of Sports Medicine's guidelines. Neurocognitive tests including Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), digit span (DS), trail making test (TMT), hand reaction time (HRT), logical memory (LM), and semantic verbal fluency test (SVFT) were administered to all participants.The obese group demonstrated significantly lower score in MoCA, DS, TMT, HRT, and LM than the normal weight group (p < 0.05). The obese with MetS subgroup (n = 28) showed significantly lower score in LM than the obese non-MetS subgroup (n = 30) (p = 0.002). Normal weight with high CRF participants (NW-high CRF; n = 28) demonstrated significantly higher score in MoCA and HRT than obese with high CRF participants (OB-high CRF; n = 24) (p < 0.05), and demonstrated better score in MoCA, DS, TMT, HRT, and LM than obese with low CRF participants (OB-low CRF; n = 24) (p < 0.05). OB-high CRF showed significantly greater score in DS, TMT and LM than OB-low CRF (p < 0.05).Obesity shows negative impact on several cognitive functions, which memory appears to be further affected when combined with MetS in middle-aged women, whereas CRF is suggested to have benefit on certain aspects of cognitive domains. Maintaining a healthy body weight and improving CRF are beneficial for cognitive function of middle-aged women.",

MBI symptoms were derived from Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire scores using a published algorithm with a cut-off of >0 indicating MBI symptom presence and higher scores indicating greater severity. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions adjusted for age, sex, education, and cognitive diagnosis were used to test the association between FI and MBI symptom presence and severity, respectively, with MBI as the outcome variable. An FI-by-sex interaction term was included to test for sex-dependent effects.The FI mean and SD across the entire cohort was 0.14 \u00b1 0.06 (median = 0.14, IQR = 0.09-0.17, range = 0.02-0.38). Higher FI scores were associated with the presence of MBI symptoms both globally and in the domains of decreased motivation, affective dysregulation, and psychosis. Higher FI scores were also associated with more severe MBI symptoms in a sex-dependent manner: both sexes reported similarly low MBI symptom severity at low (-1 SD) levels of FI but males reported 1.9x higher MBI symptom severity relative to females at high (+1 SD) levels of FI.The FI is associated with both the presence and severity of MBI, especially for males. This suggests that screening for early dementia risk should incorporate assessments of MBI for patients with frailty, and assessments of frailty for patients with MBI.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Arterial hypertension is among factors with the potential for increasing the risk of cognitive impairment in elderly subjects. However, studies investigating the effects of antihypertensives on cognitive function have reported mixed results.We have used the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS) to investigate the effect of each class of antihypertensives, both as single and combined, in reducing the rate of conversion from normal to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).The use of antihypertensive drugs was associated with 21% (Hazard ratio: 0.79, p<01001) delay in the rate of conversion to MCI. This effect was modulated by age, gender, and genotypic APOE4 allele. Among different antihypertensive subclasses, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (24%, HR: 0.76, P=0.004), diuretics (21%, HR: 0.79, P=0.006), and \u03b11-adrenergic blockers (\u03b11-ABs) (23%, HR: 0.77, P=0.034) significantly delayed the rate of MCI conversion. A significant effect was observed with the selective L-type voltage-gated CCBs, dihydropyridines, amlodipine (47%, HR=0.53, P<0.001) and nifedipine (49%, HR=0.51, P=0.012), whereas non-DHPs showed insignificant effect. Loop diuretics, potassium sparing diuretics, and thiazides all significantly reduced the rate of MCI conversion. Combination of \u03b11-AB and diuretics led to synergistic effects; combination of vasodilators plus \u03b2-blockers (\u03b2Bs), and \u03b11-AB plus \u03b2Bs led to additive effect in delaying the rate of MCI conversion, when compared to a single drug.Our results could have implications for the more effective treatment of hypertensive elderly adults who are likely to be at high risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The choice of combination of antihypertensive therapy should also consider the combination which would lead to an optimum benefit on cognitive function.",

Despite the higher prevalence of ADRD among older African Americans, recent estimates suggest research enrollment by those who identify as African American remains limited. The purpose of the study is to 1) explore how a culturally tailored community education program impacts clinical trial interest and enrollment in ADRD research studies and to 2) identify how applicable the African American community perceived the culturally tailored curriculum. Using a community-engaged research approach, we collaborated with predominately African American serving community-based organizations to support content development and delivery of Aging with Grace (AWG), a culturally tailored ADRD educational curriculum. A total of five AWG presentations were given to 66 attendees. Most attendees (67%) expressed interest in participating in clinical trials after attending AWG. Enrollment increased within an observational study (84%) and lifestyle prevention clinical trials (52%) from 2018 to 2019. Attendees (32%) also perceived an increase in ADRD knowledge from attending AWG and 89.1% believed more African Americans should participate in research. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of a culturally tailored community education program to enhance knowledge, clinical trial interest, and recruitment into observational studies and lifestyle ADRD clinical trials among older African Americans. Education programs developed in partnership with the community can serve as bridge to research participation for underrepresented minorities in clinical research. Future studies should assess long-term retention of knowledge and research readiness.",

However, evidence in populations with non-US food culture, especially from Europe, is limited.To evaluate the association of a French-adapted MIND diet score with gray matter volumes, white matter microstructure and incident dementia.This longitudinal study included participants from the population-based Three-City Bordeaux cohort (\u226565 years), with a follow-up from June 2001 to February 2018.Dementia-free participants at dietary assessment, in 2001-2002, who underwent systematic detection of incident dementia (over up to 7 visits). A subset of the cohort was included in an ancillary MRI study in 2010-2011.A French-adapted MIND diet score (range, 0-15) was computed from a 148-item Food Frequency Questionnaire and a 24-hour recall administered at home. Incident dementia and its subtypes were adjudicated by an expert committee; and gray matter volumes and white matter microstructure were assessed by 3D-T1 MRI and diffusion-MRI.Among 1,412 participants (mean age, 75.8 [SD, 4.8]; 63% women), followed for a median of 9.7 years (maximum 16.3 years), 356 (25.2%) developed incident dementia. In multivariable-adjusted Cox model, a higher French MIND diet score was associated with lower risks of dementia and AD (hazard ratios for 1-point of score = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.95] and 0.88 [0.81-0.96], respectively). In Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis of 175 participants included in the MRI sub-study, a higher MIND diet score was associated with lower diffusivity values in the splenium of the corpus callosum (P < .05 after Family-Wise Error-correction). In contrast, there was no significant association of the adapted MIND diet score with gray matter volumes in Voxel-Based Morphometry analysis.In this cohort of French older adults, higher adherence to the French MIND diet was associated with a lower dementia risk and with preserved white matter microstructure.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Cognitive reserve has been hypothesized as a mechanism to explain differences in individual risk for symptomatic expression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Inappropriate medications may diminish cognitive reserve, precipitating the transition from preclinical AD (pAD) to a symptomatic state. To date, there is limited data on the potential impact of medication optimization as a potential tool for slowing the symptomatic expression of AD.(1) To test the efficacy of a medication therapy management intervention designed to bolster cognitive reserve in community-dwelling older adults without dementia.

Randomization was stratified by amyloid \u03b2 positron emission tomography levels.Community-based, Lexington, Kentucky.Adults 65 years or older with no evidence of dementia and reporting at least one potentially inappropriate medication as listed in the Beers 2015 criteria were recruited. The study aimed to enroll 90 participants based on the a priori sample size calculation.Medication therapy management versus standard of care.Primary outcomes were: (1) one-year changes in the Medication Appropriateness Index; (2) one-year changes in Trail Making Test B under scopolamine challenge.The medication therapy management intervention resulted in significant improvement in Medication Appropriateness Index scores. Overall, there was no beneficial effect of the medication therapy management on Trail Making Test B scores, however stratified analysis demonstrated improvement in Trail Making Test B challenged scores associated with the medication therapy management for those with elevated amyloid \u03b2 positron emission tomography levels consistent with pAD.Medication therapy management can reduce inappropriate medication use in older adults at risk for AD. Our study indicated beneficial cognitive effects in those with preclinical Alzheimer's Disease. No statistically significant effects were evident in the study group as a whole, or in those without preclinical cerebral amyloidosis. Further work designed to improve the effectiveness of the medication therapy management approach and defining other preclinical pathologic states that may benefit from medication optimization are readily achievable goals for promoting improved cognitive health and potentially delaying the onset of symptomatic AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating conditions that most commonly affect individuals 65 years and older. Currently there are no effective treatments or cures for neurodegenerative diseases, and therapeutics that selectively target the underlying causes of these diseases are needed. Epichaperomes play a major role in the maintenance and progression of neuronal pathology. Inhibiting epichaperomes induces degradation of disease associated proteins and is a promising therapeutic approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's Disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.This Phase 1 clinical study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of icapamespib, a purine scaffold inhibitor of epichaperomes that is specific to epichaperomes, in healthy subjects.Double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalating single ascending dose and multiple ascending doses and an unblinded two-period cross-over bioavailability study design.Single site in the United States.Healthy men or women of 18 to 60 years of age, inclusive, for Part 1 (single ascending dose), \u2265 60 years of age for Part 2 (multiple ascending dose), or 18 to 49 years of age for Part 3 (bioavailability).In the single ascending dose group, oral single doses (10, 20, and 30 mg icapamespib or placebo) were administered to healthy non-elderly subjects. In the multiple ascending dose group, multiple doses (20 and 30 mg icapamespib once daily for 7 days or placebo) were administered to healthy elderly subjects. In the bioavailability group, the bioavailability of once daily oral icapamespib solution and tablet was assessed in healthy non elderly subjects.Safety was evaluated based on assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. Icapamespib concentration was evaluated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, the latter in Part 2 (multiple ascending dose) only.Forty-eight subjects in total were randomized and assessed for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability parameters as follows: 24 subjects in Part 1 (single ascending dose) with PU-AD 10 mg (n = 6), 20 mg (n = 6), 30 mg (n = 6), and placebo (n = 6); 16 subjects in Part 2 (multiple ascending dose) with icapamespib 20 mg (n = 6), 30 mg (n = 6), and placebo (n = 4); and 8 subjects in Part 3 (bioavailability) crossed-over between icapamespib 30 mg (tablet) and icapamespib 30 mg (oral solution). Single doses of icapamespib up to 30 mg and multiple doses of icapamespib up to 30 mg for 7 days were generally safe and well tolerated in healthy non-elderly and elderly subjects. Treatment-emergent adverse events were mild, with headache being the most common treatment-emergent adverse event. Mean icapamespib exposure (area under the curve) was dose-proportional over the dose range tested. The median time to maximum observed plasma concentration ranged from 1.00 to 2.00 h across single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose, and bioavailability groups; icapamespib exposure was 50% higher in elderly subjects compared with non-elderly subjects but was well tolerated.The study provides clinical evidence of the safety of icapamespib in healthy non elderly and elderly subjects and supports the advancement of icapamespib to Phase 2 evaluation in Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an essential outcome in Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention trials and a compelling milestone for clinically meaningful change. Determining MCI, however, may be variable and subject to disagreement. Adjudication procedures may improve the reliability of these determinations. We report the performance of an adjudication committee for an AD prevention trial.The TOMMORROW prevention trial selected cognitively normal participants at increased genetic risk for AD and randomized them to low-dose pioglitazone or placebo treatment. When adjudication criteria were triggered, a participant's clinical information was randomly assigned to a three-member panel of a six-member independent adjudication committee. Determination of whether or not a participant reached MCI due to AD or AD dementia proceeded through up to three review stages - independent review, collaborative review, and full committee review - requiring a unanimous decision and ratification by the chair.Of 3494 participants randomized, the committee adjudicated on 648 cases from 386 participants, resulting in 96 primary endpoint events. Most participants had cases that were adjudicated once (n = 235, 60.9%); the rest had cases that were adjudicated multiple times. Cases were evenly distributed among the eight possible three-member panels. Most adjudicated cases (485/648, 74.8%) were decided within the independent review (stage 1); 14.0% required broader collaborative review (stage 2), and 11.1% needed full committee discussion (stage 3). The primary endpoint event decision rate was 39/485 (8.0%) for stage 1, 29/91 (31.9%) for stage 2, and 28/72 (38.9%) for stage 3. Agreement between the primary event outcomes supported by investigators' clinical diagnoses and the decisions of the adjudication committee increased from 50% to approximately 93% (after around 100 cases) before settling at 80-90% for the remainder of the study.The adjudication process was designed to provide independent, consistent determinations of the trial endpoints. These outcomes demonstrated the extent of uncertainty among trial investigators and agreement between adjudicators when the transition to MCI due to AD was prospectively assessed. These methods may inform clinical endpoint determination in future AD secondary prevention studies. Reliable, accurate assessment of clinical events is critical for prevention trials and may mean the difference between success and failure.",

The presence of two apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE\u03b54) alleles (vs no \u03b54 alleles) in the A\u03b2+ cohort increased the odds for presence of MCH (odds ratio [OR] = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.23 to 3.27, P = 0.004). Cortical infarctions (4% vs 0%) and subcortical infarctions (10% vs 1%) were observed at statistically significantly higher prevalence in the A\u03b2+ cohort compared with A\u03b2- (P < 0.001). Females showed reduced odds of MCH in the A\u03b2+ cohort by a factor of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84, P = 0.002).ARIA-E is rare in cognitively unimpaired A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2- populations prior to anti-amyloid drug intervention. ARIA-H in A\u03b2+ was greater than in A\u03b2- populations.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted to determine the effect of physical exercise on physical-functional capacity, cognitive performance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life in a population of older people with Alzheimer\u00b4s disease.Pubmed, Scopus, PEDro, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, grey literature and a reverse search from inception to April 2021 were searched to identify documents.Publications investigating the effect of any type of physical exercise-based intervention in any of its multiple modalities on physical-functional capacity, cognitive performance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life were searched.The data were extracted into predesigned data extraction tables. Risk of bias was evaluated through the PEDro scale and its internal validity scale.A total of 8 different randomized controlled trials with a total sample of 562 non-overlap Alzheimer disease patients between 50-90 years and a mean age of 75.2 \u00b1 3.9 years were eligible for analyses. Physical-functional capacity was evaluated in 6 of 8 studies and cognitive performance was evaluated in 5 of 8 studies, all of them showed improvements in these variables when compared with the controls, except for two studies in physical-functional capacity and one study for cognitive performance. In the physical-functional capacity and cognitive performance variables, aerobic physical exercise was used in isolation, or in a multimodal way, combining aerobic, strength and balance exercise, from 2 to 7 weekly sessions with doses between 30 and 90 minutes, and a duration of the program comprised of 9 weeks to 6 months. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life were evaluated in 2 of 8 studies, which the intervention groups experienced significant improvements when compared with the control groups, except for one study that found similar differences in quality of life between both groups. In the neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life variables, only aerobic physical exercise was used, in a more homogeneous way, from 2 to 3 weekly sessions with doses of 30 to 60 minutes, and a total program duration of 9 to 16 weeks.Despite the scarcity of studies, especially those based on multimodal proposals, and the heterogeneity in the protocols, this systematic review found moderate to limited evidence that aerobic physical exercise on its own or combined in a multimodal program that also includes strength and balance exercise can be a useful tool in the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease with the aim of maintaining and/or improving physical-functional capacity and cognitive performance. In addition, this review found moderate evidence of the positive impact that aerobic physical exercise could have in reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with Alzheimer\u00b4s disease.

        "ArticleAbstract": "The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are low costing and noninvasive neuropsychological tests in screening Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is no consensus on which test performs better in detecting MCI due to AD based on the different imperfect reference standards. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic performance of MMSE and MoCA for screening MCI due to AD in the absence of a gold standard.Six electronic databases were searched for relevant studies until April, 2022. A hierarchical Bayesian latent class model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity of MoCA and MMSE in the absence of a gold standard.90 eligible studies covering 21273 individuals for MMSE, 26631 individuals for MoCA were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity was 0.71(95%CI: 0.67-0.74) for MMSE and 0.85(95%CI: 0.83-0.88) for MoCA, while the pooled specificity was 0.71(95%CI: 0.68-0.74) for MMSE and 0.79(95%CI: 0.76-0.81) for MoCA. MoCA was useful to \"rule in\" and \"rule out\" the diagnosis of MCI due to AD with higher positive likelihood ratio (4.07; 95%CI: 3.60-4.62) and lower negative likelihood ratio (0.18; 95%CI: 0.16-0.22). Moreover, the diagnostic odds ratio of MoCA was 22.08(95%CI: 17.24-28.29), which showed significantly favorable diagnostic performance.It suggests that MoCA has greater diagnostic performance than MMSE for differentiating MCI due to AD when the gold standard is absent. However, these results should be taken with caution given the heterogeneity observed.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive manifestation of aging associated with accumulated Amyloid \u03b2. It remains frustratingly unclear why this protein accumulates and how it contributes to Alzheimer's Disease pathology. In one recent hypothesis, Amyloid \u03b2 is suggested to function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immune defense within the brain, where Amyloid \u03b2 gains toxicity when it becomes abundant. This essay proposes an evolutionary explanation for why Amyloid \u03b2 expression is regulated at an optimum based on its function as a defense and how this leads to disease. Among its potential physiological functions, Amyloid \u03b2 confers benefits to reduce direct pathogen damage while this simultaneously entails cellular cost of defense. Optimal Amyloid \u03b2 expression occurs when the gain in fitness from an incremental increase is balanced by the marginal cost of this increase. It proposes that natural selection acting upon the young favored systems to maintain Amyloid \u03b2 at an optimal level through mechanisms that induce the defense and repress its expression. With age, the force of natural selection declines and permits mechanisms of negative feedback repression to degenerate. Consequently, Amyloid \u03b2 is expressed beyond its optimum. Age also elevates cumulative pathogen exposure, reduces pathogen barriers and reactivates latent pathogens. The net effect is elevated, chronic induction of Amyloid \u03b2 in the brain. The model recommends attention to innate immune negative regulation in the brain to discover ways to restore these functions toward a youthful state in the elderly.",

This study tested the hypothesis that altered protein levels in blood plasma could serve as biomarkers of NPS; and that altered protein levels are associated with persisting NPS and cognitive decline over time. We performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal study in older subjects with cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired in a memory clinic setting. NPS were recorded through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) while cognitive and functional impairment was assessed using the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SoB) score at baseline and follow-up visits. Shotgun proteomic analysis based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted in blood plasma samples, identifying 420 proteins. The presence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology was determined by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Eighty-five subjects with a mean age of 70 (\u00b1\u20097.4) years, 62% female and 54% with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia were included. We found 15 plasma proteins with altered baseline levels in participants with NPS (NPI-Q score >\u20090). Adding those 15 proteins to a reference model based on clinical data (age, CDR-SoB) significantly improved the prediction of NPS (from receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) 0.75 to AUC 0.91, p =\u20090.004) with a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 74%. The identified proteins additionally predicted both persisting NPS and cognitive decline at follow-up visits. The observed associations were independent of the presence of AD pathology. Using proteomics, we identified a panel of specific blood proteins associated with current and future NPS, and related cognitive decline in older people. These findings show the potential of untargeted proteomics to identify blood-based biomarkers of pathological alterations relevant for NPS and related clinical disease progression.",

The exact pathogenesis and genetic background of AD are unclear and there remains no effective treatment option. Sarcosine, an n-methyl derivative of glycine, showed a promising therapeutic strategy for some cognitive disorders. To our knowledge, the impacts of sarcosine supplementation against AD have not yet been elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to determine the neuroprotective potential of sarcosine in in vitro and in vivo AD model. In vitro studies have demonstrated that sarcosine increased the percentage of viable cells against aluminum induced neurotoxicity. In AlCl3-induced rat model of AD, the level of antioxidant capacity was significantly decreased and expression levels of APP, BACE1, TNF-\u03b1, APH1A, and PSENEN genes were elevated compared to the control group. Additionally, histopathological examinations of the hippocampus of AlCl3-induced rat brains showed the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, the administration of sarcosine produced marked improvement and protection of AD-associated pathologies induced by AlCl3 in experimental rats. Therefore, this investigation may contribute to design novel therapeutic strategies using sarcosine for the management of AD pathologies.",

Out of 147 participants, 94.6% had intention to take AD-preventive medicines and 46.3% had experience of taking cognitive function supplements. The intention to take AD-preventive medicines were significantly influenced by self-efficacy (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 1.87) and dementia knowledge (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.13, 10.39), whereas prior experience of cognitive function supplements was significantly associated with cue to action (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07, 1.40). AD-preventive lifestyle was significantly influenced by socio-demographics such as age, sex, and marital status, and the HBM factors such as perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and cue to action. Self-efficacy, cue to action, dementia knowledge, and perceived susceptibility were significantly associated with preventive behaviors of AD. Also, family members of dementia patients, who are at risk of dementia due to genetic factors, lifestyles, and environment factors, had high level of AD-preventive lifestyle and strong intention to take AD-preventive medicines.

Infectious diseases, in general, confer a risk of AD. Influenza and pneumonia vaccinations reduce risk of AD. Being vaccinated against pneumonia between ages 65-75 is associated with a reduction in the risk of AD afterwards. Protection against bacterial and viral infection is beneficial to the brain since these infections may activate dormant herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes zoster virus (HZV). HSV-1 and HZV may interact to trigger AD. Shingles (HZV) vaccine Zostavax reduces risk of AD and PD. This finding is consistent with the link between viruses and neurodegeneration. Herpes virus-induced reactivation of embryologic pathways silenced at birth could be one of the pathologic processes in AD and PD. Once embryologic reactivation has occurred in the brain of an older person and AD or PD develops, this complex process relentlessly destroys the protective mechanism it created in utero.

Linear regression analysis revealed that individuals with the BIN1 risk allele performed poorly on the recognition memory task as compared to those without the risk allele. However, this was in contrast with the individuals who harboured the APOE \u03b54 risk allele as they displayed better performance on the recognition task in comparison to those without the \u03b54 risk allele.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Central response to insulin is suspected to be defective in Alzheimer's disease. As most insulin is secreted in the bloodstream by the pancreas, its capacity to regulate brain functions must, at least partly, be mediated through the cerebral vasculature. However, how insulin interacts with the blood-brain barrier and whether alterations of this interaction could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology both remain poorly defined. Here, we show that human and murine cerebral insulin receptors (INSRs), particularly the long isoform INSR\u03b1-B, are concentrated in microvessels rather than in the parenchyma. Vascular concentrations of INSR\u03b1-B were lower in the parietal cortex of subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positively correlating with cognitive scores, leading to a shift towards a higher INSR\u03b1-A/B ratio, consistent with cerebrovascular insulin resistance in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Vascular INSR\u03b1 was inversely correlated with amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, but positively correlated with insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and P-glycoprotein. Using brain cerebral intracarotid perfusion, we found that the transport rate of insulin across the blood-brain barrier remained very low (<0.03\u2005\u00b5l/g\u00b7s) and was not inhibited by an insulin receptor antagonist. However, intracarotid perfusion of insulin induced the phosphorylation of INSR\u03b2 that was restricted to microvessels. Such an activation of vascular insulin receptor was blunted in 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease neuropathology induces insulin resistance at the level of the blood-brain barrier. Overall, the present data in post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brains and an animal model of Alzheimer's disease indicate that defects in the insulin receptor localized at the blood-brain barrier strongly contribute to brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease, in association with \u03b2-amyloid pathology.",

Previous research found that elevated orexin level in the cerebrospinal fluid was closely related to the course of AD, and orexin-A treatment could increase amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) deposition and aggravate spatial memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, recent research found that dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonist might affect A\u03b2 level and cognitive dysfunction in AD, but the effects of OX1R or OX2R alone is unreported until now. Considering that OX1R is highly expressed in the hippocampus and plays important roles in learning and memory, the effects of OX1R in AD cognitive dysfunction and its possible mechanism should be investigated. In the present study, selective OX1R antagonist SB-334867 was used to block OX1R. Then, different behavioral tests were performed to observe the effects of OX1R blockade on cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice exhibited both A\u03b2 and tau pathology, in vivo electrophysiological recording and western blot were used to investigate the potential mechanism. The results showed that chronic OX1R blockade aggravated the impairments of short-term working memory, long-term spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in 9-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice, increased levels of soluble A\u03b2 oligomers and p-tau, and decreased PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. These results indicate that the detrimental effects of SB-334867 on cognitive behaviors in 3xTg-AD mice are closely related to the decrease of PSD-95 and depression of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) caused by increased A\u03b2 oligomers and p-tau.",

        "ArticleTitle": "[A role of human microbiota in the development of neurodegenerative diseases].",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Improving the quality of life in developed countries has contributed to an increase in its duration, which has led to an increase in the number of reported cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in the world. Today, there are 26.6 million patients with AD in the world and it is suspected that by 2050 the number of such patients may increase four times. Additionally, PD in different countries is recorded among people above 60-65 years old at a level of 167 to 5703 per 100.000 population. The latest studies have made it possible to formulate the main mechanisms of the \u00abmicrobiota-gut-brain\u00bb axis associated with the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the currently available information on the possible role of the gut microbiota in the AD and PD development. It was shown that oxidative stress is one of the main pathogenetic mechanisms of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the deposition of lipopolysaccharides of gram-negative bacteria and amyloid of microbial origin in the brain tissue of patients with impaired permeability of the intestinal barrier plays an important role in AD. In PD, the synthesis of \u03b1-synuclein produced by bacteria and neuroinflammation are of the greatest importance. Knowledge of these mechanisms will allow the development of psychobiotics, which will reduce the risk of neurodegeneration in AD and PD.\u041f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435

        "ArticleTitle": "[Focused ultrasound as a non-invasive method with therapeutic potential in patients with Alzheimer's disease].",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal deposition of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of this method in patients with AD.\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430

        "ArticleTitle": "[Vascular cognitive impairment].",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment is considered the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. One of the most significant factors leading to vascular dementia is stroke, which increases the risk of developing dementia by about 2 times. Delayed-onset post-stroke dementia is mainly due to severe small vessel disease, recurrent stroke, or concomitant Alzheimer's disease. Among the many mechanisms involved in the development of vascular cognitive impairment, cerebral small vessel disease is perhaps the most common, contributing to cognitive impairment independent of stroke. An important feature of small vessel disease is its steady progression. The cognitive decline in cerebrovascular disease, including small vessel disease, is also usually gradual and gradual, progresses slowly, and the underlying defect extends to processing speed, complex attention, and fronto-executive functions. Vascular cognitive impairments are quite heterogeneous in nature, while having a negative impact on all major cognitive domains. Patient management should include the earliest possible diagnosis of cognitive impairment and the appointment of timely therapy. One of the drugs that has been successfully used to treat vascular cognitive impairment is nicergoline (Sermion). The clinical efficacy of the drug is achieved due to the improvement of cerebral blood flow, a positive effect on cholinergic neurotransmission and neuroprotective action.\u0421\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f

Prior to death, participants were observed for a mean (SD) of 8.4 (5.3) years with annual assessments. From 2096 participants who died, 1799 (85.8%) underwent autopsy and 1767 had complete postmortem pathological examination data at the time of data analyses. To identify participants without neurodegenerative pathologies, we categorized them in 3 subgroups. A vascular subgroup was composed of participants without significant levels of neurodegenerative brain pathologies. A neurodegenerative subgroup was composed of participants without significant levels of cerebrovascular disease pathologies. A mixed subgroup was composed of the rest of the participants. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to July 2022.Brain pathology indices obtained by postmortem pathological assessments.The primary outcome was cognitive impairment defined by presence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The secondary outcome was cognition assessed by 19 neuropsychological tests.Of 1767 included participants, 1189 (67.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age at death was 89.4 (6.6) years. In the vascular subgroup (n\u2009=\u2009369), cognitive impairment was present in 156 participants (42.3%) and was associated with cerebrovascular disease pathologies (macroinfarcts: odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% CI, 1.49-2.82; P\u2009<\u2009.001; arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia: OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04-1.76; P\u2009=\u2009.03) but not AD or other neurodegenerative pathologies, an indication of pure VCI. In mixed-effects models including all the pathologies, only macroinfarcts were associated with a faster cognitive decline rate (estimate, -0.019; SE, 0.005; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in the vascular subgroup. Further analyses identified macroinfarcts in the frontal white matter to be associated with faster cognitive decline rate when macroinfarcts of cortical and subcortical brain regions were examined in a single model.In this study, pure VCI was not rare. Macroinfarcts, specifically in frontal white matter, were the main cerebrovascular disease pathologies associated with cognitive decline in pure VCI.",

To this aim, we evaluated its results regarding symptomatology and caregiver burden. Methods: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. We searched Pubmed/Medline (NLM), Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane and Google Scholar, including articles from 1 January 2011-20 July 2021, using the keywords \"Alzheimer\u00b4s disease\", \"Music therapy\", \"Caregivers overload\", \"Amnesia retrograde\" and \"Clinical evolution\". To select the articles our criteria included complete text availability, quantitative research of an experimental nature and studies which, at least, figured in SJR or in JCR. Results: We found a relationship between the application of music therapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease and an improvement regarding symptomatology, as it smoothed down the progress of the disease. Using music therapy in Alzheimer's patients also led to a decrease in caregivers' burden and an increase in their well-being. Conclusions: Our results showed the benefits of music therapy, as it improved both patients' symptomatology and caregivers' burden.",

However, the early symptoms of AD are not obvious and difficult to diagnose. Existing studies have rarely explored the mechanism of early AD. AMPARs are early important learning memory-related receptors. However, it is not clear how the expression levels of AMPARs change in early AD.We explored learning memory abilities and AMPAR expression changes in APP/PS1 mice at 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months.We used the classic Morris water maze to explore the learning and memory impairment of APP/PS1 mice and used western blotting to explore the changes in AMPARs in APP/PS1 mice.We found that memory impairment occurred in APP/PS1 mice as early as 4 months of age, and the impairment of learning and memory gradually became serious with age. The changes in GluA1 and p-GluA1 were most pronounced in the early stages of AD in APP/PS1 mice.Our study found that memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice could be detected as early as 4 months of age, and this early injury may be related to GluA1.",

Cognitive function was followed up for 2 yrs. Based on the Python platform Anaconda, 105 patients were randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%) by analyzing all features through a random forest algorithm, and a prediction model was established for the form of rapidly deteriorating MCI.Of the 105 patients enrolled, 41 deteriorated and 64 did not within 2 yrs. Model 1 was established based on demographic characteristics, hematological indicators and multi-modal MRI image features, the accuracy of the training set being 100%, accuracy of the test set 64%, sensitivity 50%, specificity 67%, and AUC 0.72. Model 2 was based on the first five features (APOE4 gene, FA value of left fusiform gyrus, FA value of left inferior temporal gyrus, FA value of left parahippocampal gyrus, ADC value of right calcarine fissure assurrounding cortex), the accuracy of the training set being 100%, accuracy of the test set 85%, sensitivity 91%, specificity 80% and AUC 0.96. Model 3 was based on the first four features of Model 1, the accuracy of the training set being 100%, accuracy of test set 97%, sensitivity100%, specificity 95% and AUC 0.99. Model 4 was based on the first three characteristics of Model 1, the accuracy of the training set being 100%, accuracy of the test set 94%, sensitivity 92%, specificity 94% and AUC 0.96. Model 5 was based on the hematological characteristics, the accuracy of the training set being 100%, accuracy of the test set 91%, sensitivity 100%, specificity 88% and AUC 0.97. The models based on the demographic characteristics, imaging characteristics FA, CBF and ADC values had lower sensitivity and specificity.Model 3, which has four important predictive characteristics, can predict the rapidly deteriorating MCI due to AD in the community.",

We report the clinical and genetic characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals carrying a novel APP duplication rearrangement.Individuals belonging to a seven-generation pedigree with familial cognitive decline or intra-cerebral hemorrhages were recruited. Participants underwent medical, neurological, and neuropsychological evaluations. The genetic analysis included chromosomal microarray, Karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and whole genome sequencing.Of 68 individuals, six females presented with dementia, and four males presented with intracerebral hemorrhage. Of these, nine were found to carry Chromosome 21 copy number gain (chr21:27,224,097-27,871,284, GRCh37/hg19) including the APP locus (APP-dup). In seven, Chromosome 5 copy number gain (Chr5: 24,786,234-29,446,070, GRCh37/hg19) (Chr5-CNG) co-segregated with the APP-dup. Both duplications co-localized to chromosome 18q21.1 and segregated in 25 pre-symptomatic carriers. Compared to non-carriers, asymptomatic carriers manifested cognitive decline in their mid-thirties. A third of the affected individuals carried a diagnosis of a dis-immune condition.APP extra dosage, even in isolation and when located outside chromosome 21 is pathogenic. The clinical presentation of APP duplication varies and may be gender specific, i.e., ICH in males and cognitive-behavioral deterioration in females. The association with immune disorders is presently unclear but may prove relevant. The implication of Chr5-CNG co-segregation and the surrounding chromosome 18 genetic sequence needs further clarification.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Many identified mechanisms could be upstream of the prominent amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD).To profile the progression of pathology in AD.We monitored metabolic signaling, redox stress, intraneuronal amyloid-\u03b2 (iA\u03b2) accumulation, and extracellular plaque deposition in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice across the lifespan.Intracellular accumulation of aggregated A\u03b2 in the CA1 pyramidal cells at 9 months preceded extracellular plaques that first presented in the CA1 at 16 months of age. In biochemical assays, brain glutathione (GSH) declined with age in both 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic controls, but the decline was accelerated in 3xTg-AD brains from 2 to 4 months. The decline in GSH correlated exponentially with the rise in iA\u03b2. Integrated metabolic signaling as the ratio of phospho-Akt (pAkt) to total Akt (tAkt) in the PI3kinase and mTOR pathway declined at 6, 9, and 12 months, before rising at 16 and 20 months. These pAkt/tAkt ratios correlated with both iA\u03b2 and GSH levels in a U-shaped relationship. Selective vulnerability of age-related AD-genotype-specific pAkt changes was greatest in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. To demonstrate redox causation, iA\u03b2 accumulation was lowered in cultured middle-age adult 3xTg-AD neurons by treatment of the oxidized redox state in the neurons with exogenous cysteine.The order of pathologic progression in the 3xTg-AD mouse was loss of GSH (oxidative redox shift) followed by an pAkt/tAkt metabolic shift in CA1, iA\u03b2 accumulation in CA1, and extracellular A\u03b2 deposition.

The profiles of autoantibodies are dysregulated in AD patients.This study aims to investigate the relative levels and clinical relevance of naturally occurring antibodies to PS1 (NAbs-PS1) in AD.A total of 55 subjects with AD (including both dementia and mild cognitive impairment due to AD), 28 subjects with cognitive impairment (including both dementia and mild cognitive impairment) not due to AD (non-AD CI), and 70 cognitively normal (CN) subjects were recruited. One-site ELISA was utilized to determine the relative levels of NAbs-PS1 in plasma.AD patients had lower plasma levels of NAbs-PS1 than CN and non-AD CI subjects. Plasma NAbs-PS1 were negatively associated with the brain A\u03b2 load, as reflected by PET-PiB SUVR, and were positively associated with cognitive functions of participants. Plasma NAbs-PS1 discriminated AD patients from CN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.730, a sensitivity of 69.09%, and a specificity of 67.14%, and they discriminated AD patients from non-AD CI subjects with an AUC of 0.750, a specificity of 70.91%, and a sensitivity of 71.43%.This study found an aberrant immunological phenotype in AD patients.

Blood was collected via catheters from superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC) proximal to the hepatic vein, the right femoral vein, and femoral artery (FA) simultaneously during RFCA. Plasma \u03b1-syn levels of AVRT patients and soluble \u03b1-syn levels of the brain samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.The \u03b1-syn concentrations in different locations of veins were divided by time-matched arterial \u03b1-syn concentrations to generate the venous/arterial (V/A) ratio. The V/A ratio of \u03b1-syn from the SVC was 1.204 (1.069-1.339, 95% CI), while the V/A ratio of \u03b1-syn from IVC was 0.831 (0.734-0.928, 95% CI), suggesting that brain-derived \u03b1-syn in the arterial blood was physiologically cleared while going through the peripheral organs and tissues. And it was estimated that about half of brain soluble \u03b1-syn can efflux and be cleared in the periphery. Moreover, the glomerular filtration rate was found correlated with V-A difference (FA-ICV) (p\u200a=\u200a0.0272).Under physiological conditions, brain-derived \u03b1-syn could efflux into and be catabolized by the peripheral system.

However, the impact of chronic PS on the risk of developing DACD remains unclear. There is growing evidence that gut flora interventions are promising targets for treating stress-related diseases.We examined whether chronic PS triggers or exacerbates the onset of DACD in rats and aimed to elucidate whether ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR) prevents and treats chronic PS-aggravated DACD by dynamically maintaining the components of the gut microbiota.We performed chronic PS (restraint, rotation, and congestion) on ZDF rats to establish a model. Cognitive function was evaluated by behavioral experiments, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was detected by ELISA. Weekly feces from rats were collected for 16\u200aS RNA sequencing.We found that chronic PS promoted cognitive abnormalities and exacerbated DACD phenotypes. Additionally, chronic PS altered intestinal flora diversity, dynamically elevating the abundance of Alistipes and Coprococcus; enriching Module 1 (Dorea, Blautia, Ruminococcus) and Module 48 (Blautia); and inhibiting Module 20 (Lactobacillus, SMB53), and Module 42 (Akkermansia). ZBPYR significantly alleviated hyperglycemia and cognitive impairment in chronic PS-aggravated DACD rats and dynamically reduced the abundance of Alistipes and Coprococcus; significantly enriched Module 3 (Ruminococcus) and Module 45 (Lactobacillus, Coprococcus, SMB53); and suppressed Module 2 (Lactobacillus), Module 16 (Turicibacter, Trichococcus, Lactobacillus, 02d06, Clostridium), Module 23 (Bifidobacterium), and Module 43 (Clostridium).ZBPYR might prevent and treat chronic PS-aggravated DACD by dynamically regulating Lactobacillus, Alistipes, and Coprococcus.",

        "ArticleTitle": "It's Groundhog Day! What Can the History of Science Say About the Crisis in Alzheimer's Disease Research?",
        "ArticleAbstract": "For years now, Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has been stuck in a Groundhog-Day scenario: an endless time loop with no breakthrough in sight. Disagreement about the validity of the field's dominant approach, based on the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis, has led to a seemingly unresolvable trench war between proponents and critics. Our paper evaluates the recent scientific literature on AD from a historical and philosophical perspective. We show that AD research is a classic example of the boundary work at play in a field in crisis: both parties deploy historical and philosophical references to illustrate what counts as good and bad science, as proper scientific method and appropriate scientific conduct. We also show that boundary work has proved unable to point a way out of the deadlock and argue that the science system's tools for establishing scientific quality, such as peer review and the grant system, are unlikely to resolve the crisis. Rather, they consolidate the dominant model's position even more. In conclusion, we suggest that some kind of reverse boundary-work is needed that reopens the discussion on the nature of AD, an issue that has never been settled scientifically. Drawing on historical and philosophical work, we make clear that the definition of AD as a biomedical disease for which a cure can be found has consequences, not only for funding opportunities, but also for patients and their lives. A reconsideration of the desirability of these consequences may lead to different choices with respect to research priorities and patient care.",

The identification of fluid biomarkers of synaptic damage is emerging as a goal for early and accurate diagnosis of the disease.To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether fluid biomarkers of synaptic damage are impaired in AD.PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for articles reporting synaptic proteins as fluid biomarkers in AD and cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. Pooled effect sizes were determined using the Hedge G method with random effects. Questions adapted from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies were applied for quality assessment. A protocol for this study has been previously registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42021277487).The search strategy identified 204 articles that were assessed for eligibility. A total of 23 studies were included in the systematic review and 15 were included in the meta-analysis. For Neurogranin, 827 AD and 1,237 CU subjects were included in the meta-analysis, showing a significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD compared to CU individuals, with an effect size of 1.01 (p\u200a< \u200a0.001). A significant increase in SNAP-25 and GAP-43 levels in CSF of patients with AD was observed.Neurogranin, SNAP-25, and GAP-43 are possible biomarkers of synaptic damage in AD, and other potential synaptic biomarkers are emerging. This meta-analysis also revealed that there are still relatively few studies investigating these biomarkers in patients with AD or other dementias and showed wide heterogeneity in literature.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients frequently present with orthostatic hypotension. This inability to reflexively increase blood pressure on standing is a serious health concern and increases the risk of stroke and cardiovascular diseases.Since there are no clear mechanisms for orthostatic hypotension in human AD, the present study assessed the autonomic changes that could explain this comorbidity in an AD animal model.We used the established streptozotocin-induced rat model of AD (STZ-AD), which mimics many hallmark symptoms of sporadic AD in humans. Baroreflex responses were analyzed in anesthetized STZ-AD rats using femoral catheterization for blood pressure and heart rate, and autonomic activity was assessed using specific blockers and splanchnic sympathetic nerve recordings. Expression levels of autonomic receptors at the heart were examined using the western blot technique.Baroreflex function in STZ-AD showed a blunted heart rate (HR) response to low blood pressure challenges, and the maximal sympathetic nerve activity was reduced. Conversely, HR responses to high blood pressure were similar to control, indicating no change in parasympathetic nerve activity. Under resting conditions, autonomic blockade demonstrated a baseline shift to increased sympathetic tone in STZ-AD. Protein expression levels of beta-1 adrenergic receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 in the heart were unchanged.Our study provides the first data on the pathological influence of AD on baroreflex function, which primarily affected the sympathetic nervous system in STZ-AD. These results represent the first mechanisms that may correlate with the orthostatic hypotension in human AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "There are socioeconomic inequalities in dementia risk. Underlying pathways are not well known.To investigate whether modifiable health and lifestyle factors for brain health mediate the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive functioning in a population without dementia.The \"LIfestyle for BRAin health\" (LIBRA) score was computed for 6,203 baseline participants of the LIFE-Adult-Study. LIBRA predicts dementia in midlife and early late life, based on 12 modifiable factors. Associations of SES (education, net equivalence income, and occupational status) and LIBRA with cognitive functioning (composite score) were investigated using adjusted linear regression models. Bootstrapped structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to investigate whether LIBRA mediated the association of SES and cognitive functioning.Participants were M\u200a=\u200a57.4 (SD\u200a=\u200a10.6, range: 40-79) years old; 50.3% were female. Both, SES (Wald: F(2)=52.5, p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and LIBRA (Wald: F(1)=5.9, p\u200a<\u200a0.05) were independently associated with cognitive functioning; there was no interaction (Wald: F(2)=2.9, p\u200a=\u200a0.060). Lower SES and higher LIBRA scores indicated lower cognitive functioning. LIBRA partially mediated the association of SES and cognitive functioning (IE: =0.02, 95% CI [0.02, 0.03], p\u200a<\u200a0.001). The proportion mediated was 12.7%.Differences in cognitive functioning due to SES can be partially attributed to differences in modifiable health and lifestyle factors; but to a small extent. This suggests that lifestyle interventions could attenuate socioeconomic inequalities in cognitive functioning. However, directly intervening on the social determinants of health may yield greater benefits for dementia risk reduction.",

Tibolone (TIB) has been used as a hormone replacement therapy to alleviate climacteric symptoms. Neuroprotective effects of TIB have also been reported in some animal models.This study aimed to assess the effect of TIB on memory and A\u03b2 peptides and tau protein content in the hippocampus and cerebellum of transgenic 3xTgAD ovariectomized mice.Three-month-old female mice were ovariectomized. Ten days after surgery, animals were divided into four groups: wild-type (WT)+vehicle; WT+TIB (1\u200amg/kg); 3xTgAD+vehicle; and 3xTgAD+TIB (1\u200amg/kg). TIB was administered for three months, and memory was evaluated using the object-in-context recognition task. Subsequently, animals were decapitated, and the hippocampus and cerebellum were dissected. Using commercial ELISA kits, these brain structures were homogenized in a PBS buffer for quantifying A\u03b2 40 and A\u03b2 42 and phosphorylated and total tau.ResultsA long-term memory deficit was observed in the 3xTgAD+vehicle group. In contrast, TIB treatment improved long-term memory in the 3xTgAD+TIB group than those treated with vehicle (p\u200a< \u200a0.05). Furthermore, TIB treatment decreased A\u03b2 and tau content in the hippocampus of 3xTgAD mice compared to vehicle-treated groups (p\u200a< \u200a0.05). No significant changes were observed in the cerebellum.Chronic treatment with TIB showed neuroprotective effects and delayed AD neuropathology in the 3xTgAD mice.

We systematically searched the electronic database PubMed (MEDLINE) and used specific keywords related to our aims from January 2020 to July 2022. All articles published on COVID-19 with keywords pertaining to pre-existing neurological diseases were retrieved and subsequently analyzed. After independent review, the data from 107 articles were selected and evaluated. After analyzing the data from selected articles reviewing the effect of COVID-19 on neurological conditions, we have documented the relationship between said pre-existing neurological diseases, showing an increased risk of hospitalization, admission length, worsening of symptoms, and even mortality in COVID-19 patients.",

Diurnal cortisol patterns were assessed using five measures: awakening levels, cortisol awakening response, bedtime levels, the ratio of awakening to bedtime levels (AM/PM ratio) and total daily output. Cognition was measured in five domains: memory, working memory, processing speed, perceptual reasoning and overall cognition. AD biomarkers A\u03b242, total tau and phosphorylated tau were assessed from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cognition was measured at follow-up (average 32 months) in a subsample of participants (n=57).In assessing the associations between cortisol and cognition, higher awakening cortisol levels were associated with greater processing speed at baseline. No relationship was found between diurnal cortisol patterns and change in cognition over time or CSF AD biomarkers in the total sample. After stratification by CSF A\u03b242 levels, higher awakening cortisol levels were associated with worse memory performance in amyloid-positive participants. In amyloid-negative participants, higher bedtime cortisol levels and a lower AM/PM ratio were associated with lower overall cognition, greater awakening cortisol levels were associated with better processing speed, and a higher AM/PM ratio was associated with better perceptual reasoning. Additionally, higher awakening cortisol levels were associated with lower CSF A\u03b242 levels in amyloid-positive participants, while higher bedtime cortisol levels and a lower AM/PM ratio were associated with higher CSF total tau in amyloid-negative participants.Our findings suggest that diurnal cortisol patterns are associated with cognitive function and provide new insights into the association between diurnal cortisol patterns and AD-related CSF biomarkers. Further research is needed to examine the complex relationship between cortisol, cognition and brain pathology.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) can effectively predict by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) of the brain, but current PET images still suffer from indistinct lesion features, low signal-to-noise ratios, and severe artefacts, resulting in poor prediction accuracy for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and unclear lesion features. In this paper, an AD prediction algorithm based on group convolution and a joint loss function is proposed. First, a group convolutional backbone network based on ResNet18 is designed to extract lesion features from multiple channels, which makes the expression ability of the network improved to a great extent. Then, a hybrid attention mechanism is presented, which enables the network to focus on target regions and learn feature weights, so as to enhance the network's learning ability of the lesion regions that are relevant to disease diagnosis. Finally, a joint loss function, that avoids the overfitting phenomenon, increases the generalization of the model, and improves prediction accuracy by adding a regularization loss function to the conventional cross-entropy function, is proposed. Experiments conducted on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that the algorithm we proposed gives a prediction accuracy improvement of 2.4% over that of the current AD prediction algorithm, thus proving the effectiveness and availability of the new algorithm.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The accelerated approval of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) aducanumab as a treatment option for Alzheimer's Disease and the continued discussions about its efficacy have shown that a better understanding of immunotherapy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is needed. 89Zr-immuno-PET could be a suitable tool to open new avenues for the diagnosis of CNS disorders, monitoring disease progression, and assessment of novel therapeutics. Herein, three different 89Zr-labeling strategies and direct radioiodination with 125I of a bispecific anti-amyloid-beta aducanumab derivate, consisting of aducanumab with a C-terminal fused anti-transferrin receptor binding single chain Fab fragment derived from 8D3 (Adu-8D3), were compared ex vivo and in vivo with regard to brain uptake and target engagement in an APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mouse model and wild type animals. Methods: Adu-8D3 and a negative control antibody, based on the HIV specific B12 antibody also carrying C-terminal fused 8D3 scFab (B12-8D3), were each conjugated with NCS-DFO, NCS-DFO*, or TFP-N-suc-DFO-Fe-ester, followed by radiolabeling with 89Zr. 125I was used as a substitute for 124I for labeling of both antibodies. 30 \u00b5g of radiolabeled mAb, corresponding to approximately 6 MBq 89Zr or 2.5 MBq 125I, were injected per mouse. PET imaging was performed 1, 3 and 7 days post injection (p.i.). All mice were sacrificed on day 7 p.i. and subjected to ex vivo biodistribution and brain autoradiography. Immunostaining on brain tissue was performed after autoradiography for further validation. Results: Ex vivo biodistribution revealed that the brain uptake of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 (2.19 \u00b10.12 %ID/g) was as high as for its 125I-analog (2.21 \u00b10.15 %ID/g). [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-N-suc-Adu-8D3 showed significantly lower uptake (< 0.65 %ID/g), being in the same range as for the 89Zr-labeled controls (B12-8D3). Autoradiography of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [125I]I-Adu-8D3 showed an amyloid-beta related granular uptake pattern of radioactivity. In contrast, the [89Zr]Zr-DFO-conjugates and the control antibody groups did not show any amyloid-beta related uptake pattern, indicating that DFO is inferior for 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging of the brain in comparison to DFO* for Adu-8D3. This was confirmed by day 7 PET images showing only amyloid-beta related brain uptake for [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3. In wild type animals, such an uptake was not observed. Immunostaining showed a co-localization of all administered Adu-8D3 conjugates with amyloid-beta plaques. Conclusion: We successfully demonstrated that 89Zr-immuno-PET is suitable for imaging and quantifying amyloid-beta specific brain uptake using a bispecific aducanumab brain shuttling antibody, Adu-8D3, but only when using the novel chelator DFO*, and not DFO, for labeling with 89Zr.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Rationale: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major impediment to therapeutic intracranial drug delivery for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Focused ultrasound applied together with microbubbles (FUS+MB) is a novel technique to transiently open the BBB and increase drug delivery. Evidence suggests that FUS+MB is safe, however, the effects of FUS+MB on human BBB cells, especially in the context of AD, remain sparsely investigated. In addition, there currently are no cell platforms to test for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery. Methods: Here we generated BBB cells (induced brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs) and astrocytes (iAstrocytes)) from apolipoprotein E gene allele E4 (APOE4, high sporadic AD risk) and allele E3 (APOE3, lower AD risk) carrying patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We established mono- and co-culture models of human sporadic AD and control BBB cells to investigate the effects of FUS+MB on BBB cell phenotype and to screen for the delivery of two potentially therapeutic AD antibodies, an Aducanumab-analogue (AduhelmTM; anti-amyloid-\u03b2) and a novel anti-Tau antibody, RNF5. We then developed a novel hydrogel-based 2.5D BBB model as a step towards a more physiologically relevant FUS+MB drug delivery platform. Results: When compared to untreated cells, the delivery of Aducanumab-analogue and RNF5 was significantly increased (up to 1.73 fold), across the Transwell-based BBB models following FUS+MB treatment. Our results also demonstrated the safety of FUS+MB indicated by minimal changes in iBEC transcriptome as well as little or no changes in iBEC or iAstrocyte viability and inflammatory responses within the first 24 h post FUS+MB. Furthermore, we demonstrated successful iBEC barrier formation in our novel 2.5D hydrogel-based BBB model with significantly increased delivery (1.4 fold) of Aducanumab-analogue following FUS+MB. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a robust and reproducible approach to utilize patient cells for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery screening in vitro. With such a cell platform for FUS+MB research previously not reported, it has the potential to identify novel FUS+MB-deliverable drugs as well as screen for cell- and patient-specific effects of FUS+MB, accelerating the use of FUS+MB as a therapeutic modality in AD.",

However, there has been yet to be sufficient evidence to prove that community-level social capital is one of the determinants of dementia. This retrospective cohort study is a large, long-term, population-based study that investigated the association between community-level social trust and the risk of dementia in the Republic of Korea.Data came from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. The community-level social trust values were determined by the Korean Community Health Survey. The study population consisted of 1,974,944 participants over 50 years of age and was followed up from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019 with a latent period of 5 years from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016. Cox proportional hazards regression was utilized to obtain the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of dementia according to social trust quintiles.Participants within the highest quintile of community-level social trust had a lower risk for overall dementia (aHR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94) and Alzheimer's disease (aHR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.94) compared to those within the lowest quintile of community-level social trust. The alleviating trend association of high community-level social trust on dementia risk was maintained regardless of whether the participants had health examinations.Our findings suggest that higher community-level social trust is associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Community-level social trust is a crucial indicator of dementia and improving community-level social trust may lead to a lower risk of dementia.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "This systematic review explored the effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions in improving psychological outcomes of informal caregivers for neurodegenerative-disorder (ND) patients.We searched seven databases for English-language papers published from 1999 to May 2021. Study-eligibility required that interventions used a minimum 50% internet-facilitation, targeting unpaid, adult informal caregivers of community-based ND-patients. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pre-post evaluative studies reporting outcomes for at least one-time point post-intervention. Independent quality checks on abstract and full-text screening were completed. Data extraction encompassed interventions' features, approaches, theoretical bases and delivery-modes. The Integrated quality Criteria for the Review Of Multiple Study designs (ICROMS) framework assessed risk of bias. Alongside narrative synthesis, we calculated meta-analyses on post-intervention using outcome measures from at least two RCTs to assess effectiveness.Searches yielded 51 eligible studies with 3180 participants. In 48 studies, caregivers supported a dementia-diagnosed individual. Intervention-durations encompassed four weeks to 12 months, with usage-frequency either prescribed or participant-determined. The most frequently-used approach was education, followed by social support. We calculated meta-analyses using data from 16 RCTs. Internet-delivered interventions were superior in improving mastery (g\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20091.17 [95% CI; 0.1 to 2.24], p\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.03) and reducing anxiety (g\u2009=\u2009-1.29 [95% CI; -1.56 to -1.01], p\u2009<\u20090.01), compared to all controls. Findings were equivocal for caregivers' quality of life, burden and other outcomes. High heterogeneity reflected the multifarious combinations of approaches and delivery-modes, precluding assessment of the most efficacious intervention features. Analyses using burden and self-efficacy outcomes' follow-up data were also non-significant compared to all comparator-types. Although 32 studies met the ICROMS threshold scores, we rated most studies' evidence quality as 'very-low'.This review demonstrated some evidence for the efficacy of internet-delivered interventions targeting informal ND-caregivers. However, more rigorous studies, with longer follow-ups across outcomes and involving NDs other than dementia, are imperative to enhance the knowledge-base.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The lipid matrix of cellular membranes, directly and indirectly, regulates many vital functions of the cell. The diversity of lipids in membranes leads to the formation of ordered domains called rafts, which play a crucial role in signal transduction, protein sorting and other cellular processes. Rafts are believed to impact the development of different neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's ones, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, some types of cancer, etc. These diseases correlate with the change in the membrane lipid composition resulting from an oxidative stress, age-related processes, dysfunction of proteins, and many others. In particular, a lot of studies report a significant rise in the level of lysolipids. Physicochemical properties of rafts are determined by membrane composition, in particular, by the content of lysolipids. Lysolipids may thus regulate raft-involving processes. However, the exact mechanism of such regulation is unknown. Although studying rafts in vivo still seems to be rather complicated, liquid-ordered domains are well observed in model systems. In the present study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine how lysophospholipids influence the liquid-ordered domains in model ternary membranes. We demonstrated that even a small amount of lysolipids in a membrane significantly impacts domain size depending on the saturation of the lysolipid hydrocarbon tails and the amount of cholesterol. The mixture with the bigger relative fraction of cholesterol was more susceptible to the action of lysolipids. This data helped us to generalize our previous theoretical model of the domain size regulation by lipids with particular molecular shape expanding it to the case of lysolipids and dioleoylglycerol.",

The validity of such diagnoses has been debated and a validation assessment can improve the diagnostic accuracy for use in research studies.The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of register-derived dementia diagnoses in the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer population study (MDCS) and to validate these diagnoses using systematic criteria.MDCS is a population-based prospective study comprising 30,446 participants. Register diagnoses of dementia for the MDCS population were derived from the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) and validated through re-evaluation of available medical records by physicians.In the MDCS cohort, 2,206 participants were diagnosed with dementia according to the NPR during a mean follow-up of 18.1 years. The general dementia diagnosis was valid in 96% of the cases, but 40% of the specific dementia diagnoses were changed during the process of reevaluation. The diagnostic validity varied between 25.2% and 82.9% for the different diagnoses. The results from the validity assessment per diagnostic category revealed that the validity of the NPR diagnoses was higher for the more specific diagnoses and lower for unspecified dementia. The major diagnostic shift during the re-evaluation was from unspecified dementia to more specific diagnoses.Validation of dementia diagnoses using medical records results in more precise diagnoses. Dementia diagnoses derived from registers should be validated in order to study associations between influential factors and different dementia diagnoses.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease affecting many cellular pathways, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress (OS), and neuroinflammation. Currently, no effective treatment for AD exists.We aim to determine the effect of lithium benzoate (LiBen) in protecting neurons from amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) or other neurotoxin insults.Primary rat cortical neurons co-treated with neurotoxins and LiBen were used to examine its effect in cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) clearance, and mitochondrial functions by MTT, CellRox fluorescence staining, and seahorse assay. Then, Barnes maze and prepulse inhibition test were performed in APP/PS1 mice that received chronic LiBen treatment to assess its effect on cognitive protection. Oral bioavailability of LiBen was also assessed by pharmacokinetic study in rat plasma.In this study, we discovered that LiBen can attenuate cellular ROS level, improve mitochondrial function, increase cell viability against multiple different insults of mitochondrial dysfunction, A\u03b2 accumulation, and neuroinflammation, and promote neurogenesis. We demonstrated that LiBen has advantages over lithium or sodium benzoate alone as LiBen displays superior neuroprotective efficacy and oral bioavailability than the other two agents when being applied either alone or in combination. Furthermore, chronic administration of LiBen showed protection for cognition as well as spatial memory and reduced the senile plaque deposition in brains of AD animal models.LiBen stands as a promising therapeutic agent for improving cognition and delaying the progression of AD.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Understanding the Relationship Between Age-Related Hearing Loss and Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Evidence suggests that hearing loss (HL), even at mild levels, increases the long-term risk of cognitive decline and incident dementia. Hearing loss is one of the modifiable risk factors for dementia, with approximately 4 million of the 50 million cases of dementia worldwide possibly attributed to untreated HL. This paper describes four possible mechanisms that have been suggested for the relationship between age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia. The first mechanism suggests mitochondrial dysfunction and altered signal pathways due to aging as a possible link between ARHL and AD. The second mechanism proposes that sensory degradation in hearing impaired people could explain the relationship between ARHL and AD. The occupation of cognitive resource (third) mechanism indicates that the association between ARHL and AD is a result of increased cognitive processing that is required to compensate for the degraded sensory input. The fourth mechanism is an expansion of the third mechanism, i.e., the function and structure interaction involves both cognitive resource occupation (neural activity) and AD pathology as the link between ARHL and AD. Exploring the specific mechanisms that provide the link between ARHL and AD has the potential to lead to innovative ideas for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of AD. This paper also provides insight into the current evidence for the use of hearing treatments as a possible treatment/prevention for AD, and if auditory assessments could provide an avenue for early detection of cognitive impairment associated with AD.",

The cells and their supernatants were assessed for A\u03b2PP cleavage fragments by immunoblotting and transmission electron microscopy.Western blotting of the cell lysates with the anti-A\u03b2PP C-terminal antibody demonstrated variable molecular weight bands corresponding to full length and fragmented A\u03b2PP in lanes treated with the following factors: Tryptic soy broth (TSB), Pg381, IL-6, Pg381\u200a+\u200aIL-1\u03b2, and Pg381\u200a+\u200aTNF-\u03b1. The low molecular weight bands corresponding to the C99 dimerized fragment were observed in the Pg381 and interlukin-6 (IL-6) treated groups and were significantly more intense in the presence of Pg381 with either IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1. Bands corresponding to the dimerized C83 fragment were observed with cells treated with TNF-\u03b1 alone and with Pg381 combined with IL-1\u03b2 or IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1. The anti-A\u03b2 antibody detected statistically significant A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, levels when these two A\u03b2 species were pooled across test samples and compared to the untreated group. Electron microscopic examination of the supernatants demonstrated insoluble A\u03b240 and A\u03b242.These observations strongly imply that A\u03b2PP is an infection responsive protein cleaved via the amyloidogenic pathway on exposure to conditioned medium and in the presence of pro-inflammatory mediators.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Unravelling the mystery of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires urgent resolution given the worldwide increase of the aging population. There is a growing concern that the current leading AD hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis, does not stand up to validation with respect to emerging new data. Indeed, several paradoxes are being discussed in the literature, for instance, both the deposition of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles could occur within the brain without any cognitive pathology. Thus, these paradoxes suggest that something more fundamental is at play in the onset of the disease and other key and related pathomechanisms must be investigated.The present study follows our previous investigations on the infectious hypothesis, which posits that some pathogens are linked to late onset AD. Our studies also build upon the finding that A\u03b2 is a powerful antimicrobial agent, produced by neurons in response to viral infection, capable of inhibiting pathogens as observed in in vitro experiments. Herein, we ask what are the molecular mechanisms in play when A\u03b2 neutralizes infectious pathogens?To answer this question, we probed at nanoscale lengths with FRET (F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer), the interaction between A\u03b2 peptides and glycoprotein B (responsible of virus-cell binding) within the HSV-1 virion.The experiments show an energy transfer between A\u03b2 peptides and glycoprotein B when membrane is intact. No energy transfer occurs after membrane disruption or treatment with blocking antibody.We concluded that A\u03b2 insert into viral membrane, close to glycoprotein B, and participate in virus neutralization.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Practice effects (PEs) defined as an improvement of performance in cognition due to repeated assessments between sessions are well known in unimpaired individuals, while less is known about impaired cognition and particularly in latent brain disease as autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease. The purpose was to evaluate the general (across tests/domains) and domain-specific PE calculated as the annual rate of change (ARC) in relation to years to the estimated disease onset (YECO) and in four groups of AD: asymptomatic mutation carriers (aAD, n = 19), prodromal, i.e., symptomatic mutation carriers, criteria for AD diagnosis not fulfilled (pAD, n = 4) and mutation carriers diagnosed with AD (dAD, n = 6) as well as mutation non-carriers from the AD families serving as a healthy comparison group (HC, n = 35). Cognition was assessed at baseline and follow-up about 3 years later by 12 tests covering six domains. The aAD and HC groups were comparable at baseline in demographic characteristics (age, gender, and education), when they were in their early forties, while the pAD and dAD groups were older and cognitively impaired. The results on mean ARC for the four groups were significantly different, small, positive, and age-insensitive in the HC group, while ARC was negative and declined with time/disease advancement in AD. The differences between HC and aAD groups in mean ARC and domain-specific ARC were not significant, indicating a subtle PE in aAD in the early preclinical stage of AD. In the symptomatic stages of AD, there was no PE probably due to cognitive disease-related progression. PEs were the largest in the verbal domain in both the HC and aAD groups, indicating a relationship with cognitive vulnerability. The group-related difference in mean ARC was predominant in timekeeping tests. To conclude, the practice effect in over 3 years was suggested to be linked to procedural learning and memory.",

In-home, multi-night Sleep Profiler studies were conducted in all participants. Automated algorithms detected NRH, characterized by elevated frontopolar electromyographic power. Between-group differences in NRH were evaluated using Logistic regression, Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests.NRH was greater in the PSD group compared to non-PSD (13.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.0% vs. 3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The threshold NRH\u22655% provided the optimal between-group differentiation (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.78, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). NRH was independently associated with the PSD group after controlling for age, sex, and SSRI/SNRI use (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

The correlation between oral environment (number of teeth, periodontal tissue, and oral function) and cerebral blood flow in each brain area calculated by single photon emission computed tomography was examined.The DLB group showed a significant correlation between masticatory performance and cerebral blood flow in some areas, while no such correlation was observed in the ATD group. Significant correlations were found between periodontal pocket depth and bleeding on probing and cerebral blood flow in some areas in both groups, although the correlation was considerable in the ATD group.The results of this study suggest that the association between changes in the oral environment and cerebral blood flow may differ among patients with ATD and DLB, depending on the underlying causative disease.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The pro-inflammatory and highly amyloidogenic protein S100A9 is central to the amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade in neurodegenerative diseases leading to cognitive impairment. Molecular chaperone activity of Bri2 BRICHOS has been demonstrated against a range of amyloidogenic polypeptides. Using a combination of thioflavin T fluorescence kinetic assay, atomic force microscopy and immuno electron microscopy we show here that recombinant Bri2 BRICHOS effectively inhibits S100A9 amyloid growth by capping amyloid fibrils. Using ex-vivo neuronal network electrophysiology in mouse brain slices we also show that both native S100A9 and amyloids of S100A9 disrupt cognition-relevant gamma oscillation power and rhythmicity in hippocampal area CA3 in a time- and protein conformation-dependent manner. Both effects were associated with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and were not observed upon TLR4 blockade. Importantly, S100A9 that had co-aggregated with Bri2 BRICHOS did not elicit degradation of gamma oscillations. Taken together, this work provides insights on the potential influence of S100A9 on cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) via gamma oscillation impairment from experimentally-induced gamma oscillations, and further highlights Bri2 BRICHOS as a chaperone against detrimental effects of amyloid self-assembly.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Poor social connections (eg, small networks, infrequent interactions, and loneliness) are modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. Existing meta-analyses are limited by reporting aggregate responses, a focus on global cognition, and combining social measures into single constructs. We aimed to investigate the association between social connection markers and the rate of annual change in cognition (ie, global and domain-specific), as well as sex differences, using an individual participant data meta-analysis.We harmonised data from 13 longitudinal cohort studies of ageing in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had baseline data for social connection markers and at least two waves of cognitive scores. Follow-up periods ranged from 0 years to 15 years across cohorts. We included participants with cognitive data for at least two waves and social connection data for at least one wave. We then identified and excluded people with dementia at baseline. Primary outcomes were annual rates of change in global cognition and cognitive domain scores over time until final follow-up within each cohort study analysed by use of an individual participant data meta-analysis. Linear mixed models within cohorts used baseline social connection markers as predictors of the primary outcomes. Effects were pooled in two stages using random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed the primary outcomes in the main (partially adjusted) and fully adjusted models. Partially adjusted models controlled for age, sex, and education; fully adjusted models additionally controlled for diabetes, hypertension, smoking, cardiovascular risk, and depression.Of the 40\u2009006 participants in the 13 cohort studies, we excluded 1392 people with dementia at baseline. 38\u2009614 individual participants were included in our analyses. For the main models, being in a relationship or married predicted slower global cognitive decline (b=0\u00b7010, 95% CI 0\u00b7000-0\u00b7019) than did being single or never married; living with others predicted slower global cognitive (b=0\u00b7007, 0\u00b7002-0\u00b7012), memory (b=0\u00b7017, 0\u00b7006-0\u00b7028), and language (b=0\u00b7008, 0\u00b7000-0\u00b7015) decline than did living alone; and weekly interactions with family and friends (b=0\u00b7016, 0\u00b7006-0\u00b7026) and weekly community group engagement (b=0\u00b7030, 0\u00b7007-0\u00b7052) predicted slower memory decline than did no interactions and no engagement. Never feeling lonely predicted slower global cognitive (b=0\u00b7047, 95% CI 0\u00b7018-0\u00b7075) and executive function (b=0\u00b7047, 0\u00b7017-0\u00b7077) decline than did often feeling lonely. Degree of social support, having a confidante, and relationship satisfaction did not predict cognitive decline across global cognition or cognitive domains. Heterogeneity was low (I2=0\u00b700-15\u00b711%) for all but two of the significant findings (association between slower memory decline and living with others [I2=58\u00b733%] and community group engagement, I2=37\u00b754-72\u00b719%), suggesting robust results across studies.Good social connections (ie, living with others, weekly community group engagement, interacting weekly with family and friends, and never feeling lonely) are associated with slower cognitive decline.EU Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research grant, funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, and the US National Institute on Aging of the US National Institutes of Health.",

SCD has been largely studied as a risk condition for cognitive decline. Empirical observations suggest that persons with SCD are heterogeneous, including individuals with early Alzheimer's disease and others with psychological vulnerabilities and/or physical comorbidity. The semiology of SCD is still in its infancy, and the features predicting cognitive decline are poorly defined. The present study aims to identify subgroups of SCD using a data-driven approach and study their clinical evolution across 8 years.the study population is the InveCe.Ab population-based cohort, including cognitively unimpaired people aged 70-74\u00a0years and followed for 8\u00a0years. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was carried out to identify distinct SCD subgroups based on nine clinical and cognitive features. Longitudinal changes by baseline SCD status were estimated using linear mixed models for cognitive decline and Cox proportional-hazard model for all-cause dementia risk.out of 956 individuals, 513 were female (54%); and the mean age was 72.1 (SD\u2009=\u20091.3), education was 7.2 (3.3), and 370 (39%) reported cognitive complaints (SCD). The HCA resulted in two clusters (SCD1 and SCD2). SCD2 were less educated and had more comorbidities, cardiovascular risk and depressive symptoms than SCD1 and controls. SCD2 presented steeper cognitive decline (Mini-Mental State Examination; \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.31) and increased all-cause dementia risk (hazard-ratio\u2009=\u20093.4).at the population level, basic clinical information can differentiate individuals with SCD at higher risk of developing dementia, underlining the heterogeneous nature of this population even in a sample selected for a narrow age range, in a specific geographic area.",

Plasma biomarkers are strongly needed for specific diagnosis and potential treatment monitoring of FTD. We aimed to identify specific FTD plasma biomarker profiles discriminating FTD from AD and controls, and between FTD pathological subtypes. In addition, we compared plasma results with results in post-mortem frontal cortex of FTD cases to understand the underlying process.Plasma proteins (n\u2009=\u20091303) from pathologically and/or genetically confirmed FTD patients (n\u2009=\u200956; FTLD-Tau n\u2009=\u200916; age\u2009=\u200958.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2; 44% female, FTLD-TDP n\u2009=\u200940; age\u2009=\u200959.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9; 45% female), AD patients (n\u2009=\u200957; age\u2009=\u200965.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0; 39% female), and non-demented controls (n\u2009=\u2009148; 61.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9; 41% female) were measured using an aptamer-based proteomic technology (SomaScan). In addition, exploratory analysis in post-mortem frontal brain cortex of FTD (n\u2009=\u200910; FTLD-Tau n\u2009=\u20095; age\u2009=\u200956.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9, 60% female, and FTLD-TDP n\u2009=\u20095; age\u2009=\u200964.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7, 60% female) and non-demented controls (n\u2009=\u20094; age\u2009=\u200961.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1; 75% female) were also performed. Differentially regulated plasma and tissue proteins were identified by global testing adjusting for demographic variables and multiple testing. Logistic lasso regression was used to identify plasma protein panels discriminating FTD from non-demented controls and AD, or FTLD-Tau from FTLD-TDP. Performance of the discriminatory plasma protein panels was based on predictions obtained from bootstrapping with 1000 resampled analysis.Overall plasma protein expression profiles differed between FTD, AD and controls (6 proteins; p\u2009=\u20090.005), but none of the plasma proteins was specifically associated to FTD. The overall tissue protein expression profile differed between FTD and controls (7-proteins; p\u2009=\u20090.003). There was no difference in overall plasma or tissue expression profile between FTD subtypes. Regression analysis revealed a panel of 12-plasma proteins discriminating FTD from AD with high accuracy (AUC: 0.99). No plasma protein panels discriminating FTD from controls or FTD pathological subtypes were identified.We identified a promising plasma protein panel as a minimally-invasive tool to aid in the differential diagnosis of FTD from AD, which was primarily associated to AD pathophysiology. The lack of plasma profiles specifically associated to FTD or its pathological subtypes might be explained by FTD heterogeneity, calling for FTD studies using large and well-characterize cohorts.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Tetrandrine ameliorates cognitive deficits and mitigates tau aggregation in cell and animal models of tauopathies.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with the pathological accumulation of tau-containing tangles in the brain. Tauopathy can impair cognitive and motor functions and has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The aetiology of tauopathy remains mysterious; however, recent studies suggest that the autophagic-endolysosomal function plays an essential role in the degradation and transmission of pathological tau. We previously demonstrated that tetrandrine could ameliorate memory functions and clear amyloid plaques in transgenic AD mice by restoring autophagic-endolysosomal function. However, the efficacy of tetrandrine and the associated therapeutic mechanism in tauopathies have not been evaluated and elucidated.Novel object recognition, fear conditioning and electrophysiology were used to evaluate the effects of tetrandrine on memory functions in transgenic tau mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the effect of tetrandrine on autophagy and tau clearance in vivo. Calcium (Ca2+) imaging and flow cytometry were used to delineate the role of pathological tau and tetrandrine in lysosomal Ca2+ and pH homeostasis. Biochemical BiFC fluorescence, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas coculture of brain slices with isolated microglia was used to evaluate tau clearance ex vivo.We observed that tetrandrine treatment mitigated tau tangle development and corrected memory impairment in Thy1-hTau.P301S transgenic mice. Mechanistically, we showed that mutant tau expression disrupts lysosome pH by increasing two-pore channel 2 (TPC2)-mediated Ca2+ release, thereby contributing to lysosome alkalinization. Tetrandrine inhibits TPC2, thereby restoring the lysosomal pH, promotes tau degradation via autophagy, and ameliorates tau aggregation. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, we demonstrated that tetrandrine treatment promotes pathological tau clearance by microglia.Together, these findings suggest that pathological tau disturbs endolysosomal homeostasis to impair tau clearance. This impairment results in a vicious cycle that accelerates disease pathogenesis. The success of tetrandrine in reducing tau aggregation suggests first, that tetrandrine could be an effective drug for tauopathies and second, that rescuing lysosomal Ca2+ homeostasis, thereby restoring ALP function, could be an effective general strategy for the development of novel therapies for tauopathies.",

We evaluated participants' cognitive functions, blood biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease, and soluble triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2). We then compared these biomarkers between the DM and non-DM and across the different cognitive strata.In all cognitive strata, significantly lower levels of serum sTREM2 were observed in the DM than in the non-DM.

        "ArticleAbstract": "As the understanding of immune responses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is in its early phases, there remains an urgency to identify the cellular and molecular processes driving chronic inflammation. In AD, a subpopulation of astrocytes acquires a neurotoxic phenotype which prompts them to lose typical physiological features. While the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, evidence suggests that myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein may play a role in coordinating these cells' immune responses in AD. Herein, we combined studies in human postmortem samples with a conditional genetic knockout mouse model to investigate the link between MyD88 and astrocytes in AD. In silico analyses of bulk and cell-specific transcriptomic data from human postmortem brains demonstrated an upregulation of MyD88 expression in astrocytes in AD versus non-AD individuals. Proteomic studies revealed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein in multiple brain regions of AD subjects. These studies also showed that although overall MyD88 steady-state levels were unaffected by AD, this protein was enriched in astrocytes near amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Functional studies in mice indicated that the deletion of astrocytic MyD88 protected animals from the acute synaptic toxicity and cognitive impairment caused by the intracerebroventricular administration of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Lastly, unbiased proteomic analysis revealed that loss of astrocytic MyD88 resulted in altered astrocyte reactivity, lower levels of immune-related proteins, and higher expression of synaptic-related proteins in response to A\u03b2. Our studies provide evidence of the pivotal role played by MyD88 in the regulation of astrocytes response to AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles marked by phosphorylated tau. Increasing evidence suggests that aggregating A\u03b2 drives tau accumulation, a process that involves synaptic degeneration leading to cognitive impairment. Conversely, there is a realization that non-fibrillar (oligomeric) forms of A\u03b2 mediate toxicity in AD. Fibrillar (filamentous) aggregates of proteins across the spectrum of the primary and secondary tauopathies were the focus of recent structural studies with a filament structure based nosologic classification, but less emphasis was given to non-filamentous co-aggregates of insoluble proteins in the fractions derived from post-mortem human brains. Here, we revisited sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble extracts to characterize tau and A\u03b2 species by quantitative targeted mass spectrometric proteomics, biochemical assays, and electron microscopy. AD brain sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were greatly enriched with A\u03b242 at almost equimolar levels to N-terminal truncated microtubule binding region (MTBR) isoforms of tau with multiple site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). MTBR R3 and R4 tau peptides were most abundant in the sarkosyl-insoluble materials with a 10-fold higher concentration than N-terminal tau peptides. This indicates that the major proportion of the enriched tau was the aggregation prone N-terminal and proline rich region (PRR) of truncated mixed 4R and 3R tau with more 4R than 3R isoforms. High concentration and occupancies of site-specific phosphorylation pT181 (~\u200922 %) and pT217 (~\u200916 %) (key biomarkers of AD) along with other PTMs in the PRR and MTBR indicated a regional susceptibility of PTMs in aggregated tau. Immunogold labelling revealed that tau may exist in globular non-filamentous form (N-terminal intact tau) co-localized with A\u03b2 in the sarkosyl-insoluble pellets along with tau filaments (N-truncated MTBR tau). Our results suggest a model that A\u03b2 and tau interact forming globular aggregates, from which filamentous tau and A\u03b2 emerge. These characterizations contribute towards unravelling the sequence of events which lead to end-stage AD changes.",

The present study assessed precision of [15O]H2O derived relative and absolute CBF, and compared precision of these measures with that of (relative) CBF proxies. Dynamic [15O]H2O, [18F]florbetapir and [18F]flortaucipir PET test-retest (TrT) datasets with eleven, nine and fourteen subjects, respectively, were included. Analyses were performed using an arterial input model and/or a simplified reference tissue model, depending on the data available. Relative CBF values (i.e. K1/K1' and/or R1) were obtained using cerebellar cortex as reference tissue and TrT repeatability (i.e. precision) was calculated and compared between tracers, parameters and clinical groups. Relative CBF had significantly better TrT repeatability than absolute CBF derived from [15O]H2O (r\u2009=\u2009-0.53), while best TrT repeatability was observed for [18F]florbetapir and [18F]flortaucipir R1 (r\u2009=\u2009-0.23, r\u2009=\u2009-0.33). Furthermore, only R1 showed, better TrT repeatability for cognitively normal individuals.

        "ArticleAbstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein begins to accumulate in the brain 20 years prior to any dementia symptoms manifestation, in which A\u03b2 aggregates in the brain, causing destruction of nerve cells and resulting in memory impairments. Lifestyle and diet appear to inhibit A\u03b2 production and amyloid deposition. Therefore, identifying factors that prevent A\u03b2 production and administering them before the onset of AD, may be an effective preventive method. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit various health effects on the host and are expected to have protective effects on neurological functions via brain-gut correlation. However, the protective effects of LAB against A\u03b2 are not well understood. We investigated whether LAB feeding could ameliorate the toxicity of A\u03b2 peptide accumulation in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans expressing the human A\u03b2 peptide in neurons or muscle as an AD model. A\u03b2 expressed in muscle caused myopathy and worm paralysis, while A\u03b2 in neurons disturbed chemotactic activity. Among 14 screened strains, Lactococcus laudensis (LL) and Pediococcus parvulus (PP) prevented the AD worms from losing their chemotaxis behavior and becoming paralyzed by the A\u03b2 peptide. Immunostaining and western blotting indicated that A\u03b2 peptide was significantly suppressed in worms fed these two strains, and binding of the A\u03b2 to vitellogenin was particularly inhibited. Conversely, the mRNA level of the A\u03b2 gene did not change between LL- or PP-fed worms and the control. In conclusion, LL and PP alleviate neurotoxicity by inhibiting A\u03b2 accumulation; AD model worms can be used to screen efficient LAB for AD prevention.",

Microglia constantly scavenge various waste materials in the brain including damaged or apoptotic neurons and A\u03b2. Through phagocytosis of A\u03b2, microglia prevent the accumulation of A\u03b2 plaque in the brain. However, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, chronic exposure to A\u03b2 makes microglia to become exhausted, which reduces their phagocytic activity against A\u03b2. Since microglia play an important role in A\u03b2 clearance, enhancing microglial phagocytic activity against A\u03b2 is a promising target for AD treatment. Therefore, there is a great need for therapeutic candidate that enhances microglial A\u03b2 clearance while inhibiting microglia's pathogenic properties.In vivo studies were conducted with 5xFAD AD model mice by treating gossypetin for 13 weeks through intragastric administration. Their spatial learning and memory were evaluated through behavior tests such as Y-maze and Morris Water Maze test. Hippocampus and cortex were acquired from the sacrificed mice, and they were used for histological and biochemical analysis. Also, mouse tissues were dissociated into single cells for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Transcriptome of microglial population was analyzed. Mouse primary microglia and BV2 mouse microglial cell line were cultured and treated with fluorescent recombinant A\u03b2 to evaluate whether their phagocytic activity is affected by gossypetin.Gossypetin treatment improved the spatial learning and memory of 5xFAD by decreasing A\u03b2 deposition in the hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD. Gossypetin induced transcriptomic modulations in various microglial subpopulations, including disease-associated microglia. Gossypetin enhanced phagocytic activity of microglia while decreasing their gliosis. Gossypetin also increased MHC II+ microglial population.Gossypetin showed protective effects against AD by enhancing microglial A\u03b2 phagocytosis. Gossypetin appears to be a novel promising therapeutic candidate against AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease whose molecular mechanisms are activated several years before cognitive symptoms appear. Genotype-based prediction of the phenotype is thus a key challenge for the early diagnosis of AD. Machine learning techniques that have been proposed to address this challenge do not consider known biological interactions between the genes used as input features, thus neglecting important information about the disease mechanisms at play. To mitigate this, we first extracted AD subnetworks from several protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases and labeled these with genotype information (number of missense variants) to make them patient-specific. Next, we trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the patient-specific networks for phenotype prediction. We tested different PPI databases and compared the performance of the GNN models to baseline models using classical machine learning techniques, as well as randomized networks and input datasets. The overall results showed that GNNs could not outperform a baseline predictor only using the APOE gene, suggesting that missense variants are not sufficient to explain disease risk beyond the APOE status. Nevertheless, our results show that GNNs outperformed other machine learning techniques and that protein-protein interactions lead to superior results compared to randomized networks. These findings highlight that gene interactions are a valuable source of information in predicting disease status.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, the neuropathological formation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The best cellular correlates of the early cognitive deficits in AD patients are synapse loss and gliosis. In particular, it is unclear whether the activation of microglia (microgliosis) has a neuroprotective or pathological role early in AD. Here we report that microgliosis is an early mediator of synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of increased amyloidosis. We found that the appearance of microgliosis, synaptic dysfunction and behavioral impairment coincided with increased soluble A\u03b242 levels, and occurred well before the presence of A\u03b2 plaques. Inhibition of microglial activity by treatment with minocycline (MC) reduced gliosis, synaptic deficits and cognitive impairments at early pathological stages and was most effective when provided preventive, i.e., before the onset of microgliosis. Interestingly, soluble A\u03b2 levels or A\u03b2 plaques deposition were not affected by preventive MC treatment at an early pathological stage (4\u00a0months) whereas these were reduced upon treatment at a later stage (6\u00a0months). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of early-stage prevention of microgliosis on the development of cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, which might be clinically relevant in preventing memory loss and delaying AD pathogenesis.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is neuropathologically characterized by the deposition of the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) as amyloid plaques. A\u03b2 plaque pathology starts in the neocortex before it propagates into further brain regions. Moreover, A\u03b2 aggregates undergo maturation indicated by the occurrence of post-translational modifications. Here, we show that propagation of A\u03b2 plaques is led by presumably non-modified A\u03b2 followed by A\u03b2 aggregate maturation. This sequence was seen neuropathologically in human brains and in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice receiving intracerebral injections of human brain homogenates from cases varying in A\u03b2 phase, A\u03b2 load and A\u03b2 maturation stage. The speed of propagation after seeding in mice was best related to the A\u03b2 phase of the donor, the progression speed of maturation to the stage of A\u03b2 aggregate maturation. Thus, different forms of A\u03b2 can trigger propagation/maturation of A\u03b2 aggregates, which may explain the lack of success when therapeutically targeting only specific forms of A\u03b2.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic loci associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular mechanisms by which they confer risk are largely unknown. We conducted a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) of AD-associated loci from GWASs using untargeted metabolic profiling (metabolomics) by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). We identified an association of lactosylceramides (LacCer) with AD-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCA7 (P = 5.0 \u00d7 10-5 to 1.3 \u00d7 10-44). We showed that plasma LacCer concentrations are associated with cognitive performance and genetically modified levels of LacCer are associated with AD risk. We then showed that concentrations of sphingomyelins, ceramides, and hexosylceramides were altered in brain tissue from Abca7 knockout mice, compared with wild type (WT) (P = 0.049-1.4 \u00d7 10-5), but not in a mouse model of amyloidosis. Furthermore, activation of microglia increases intracellular concentrations of hexosylceramides in part through induction in the expression of sphingosine kinase, an enzyme with a high control coefficient for sphingolipid and ceramide synthesis. Our work suggests that the risk for AD arising from functional variations in ABCA7 is mediated at least in part through ceramides. Modulation of their metabolism or downstream signaling may offer new therapeutic opportunities for AD.",

The test requires the patient to retrieve the conceptual features of items belonging to different lexical categories.In the first study, we administered the French version of the SMT-42 to a population of healthy subjects and to patients with svPPA matched to a subgroup of the healthy subjects. In the second study, we administered the SMT-42 to four groups of patients (with svPPA, lPPA, naPPA and Alzheimer's disease [AD], respectively) to study its capacity to differentiate patients suffering from svPPA from the other patients.In the first study, 109 healthy subjects were included, 15 of whom were paired with 15 subjects presenting with svPPA. In the second study, designed to compare groups presenting a primary progressive aphasia variant and AD, 12 subjects with svPPA, 6 with naPPA and 9 with lPPA were included, along with 21 subjects with AD. The subjects presenting a semantic deficit were clearly distinguished from the others by their results on the SMT-42 (svPPA: mean\u00a0=\u00a030.0 (5.9); lPPA: mean\u00a0=\u00a037.8 (3.3), d =\u00a01.5, p =\u00a00.002; naPPA: mean\u00a0=\u00a039.8 (1.9), d =\u00a01.89, p =\u00a00.001; AD: mean\u00a0=\u00a038.5 (2.4), d =\u00a01.63, p <\u00a00.001); (svPPA: median\u00a0=\u00a031; lPPA: median\u00a0=\u00a038, U =\u00a09, p =\u00a00.002; naPPA: median\u00a0=\u00a040.5, U =\u00a01.5, p =\u00a00.001; AD: median\u00a0=\u00a039, U =\u00a013.5, p <\u00a00.001).The SMT-42 is simple, rapidly administered (3\u00a0minutes on average), easily scored and has good sensitivity, and it appears to be an effective tool for semantic screening in routine clinical practice.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that accounts for up to 80% of all dementias. Characterised by deteriorations of memory and cognitive function, the key neuropathological features are accumulations of \u03b2-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, as 'plaques' and 'tangles', respectively. Despite extensive study, however, the exact mechanism underlying aggregate formation in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive, as does the contribution of these aggregates to disease progression. Importantly, a recent evaluation of current Alzheimer's disease animal models suggested that rodent models are not able to fully recapitulate the pathological intricacies of the disease as it occurs in humans. Therefore, increasing attention is being paid to species that might make good alternatives to rodents for studying the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The sheep (Ovis aries) is one such species, although to date, there have been few molecular studies relating to Alzheimer's disease in sheep. Here, we investigated the Alzheimer's disease relevant histopathological characteristics of 22 sheep, using anti-\u03b2-amyloid (Abcam 12267 and mOC64) and phosphorylation specific anti-tau (AT8 and S396) antibodies. We identified numerous intraneuronal aggregates of both \u03b2-amyloid and tau that are consistent with early Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. We confirmed the expression of two 3-repeat (1N3R, 2N3R) and two 4-repeat (1N4R, 2N4R) tau isoforms in the ovine brain, which result from the alternative splicing of two tau exons. Finally, we investigated the phosphorylation status of the serine396 residue in 30 sheep, and report that the phosphorylation of this residue begins in sheep aged as young as 2\u00a0years. Together, these data show that sheep exhibit naturally occurring \u03b2-amyloid and tau pathologies, that reflect those that occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This is an important step towards the validation of the sheep as a feasible large animal species in which to model Alzheimer's disease.",

Digital image analysis techniques can elucidate patterns of tau pathology more precisely than traditional methods but repeatability across centers is unclear. We calculated regional percentage areas occupied by tau pathological inclusions from the middle frontal cortex (MFC), superior temporal cortex (STC), and angular gyrus (ANG) from cases from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California San Diego with AD, LBD+tau, PSP, or CBD (n\u2009=\u2009150) using QuPath. In both cohorts, AD and LBD+tau had the highest grey and white matter tau burden in the STC (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.04). White matter tau burden was relatively higher in 4R-tauopathies than 3R/4R-tauopathies (p\u2009<\u20090.003).

What should the elderly and people with dementia do and how the society should accommodate these special groups have aroused heated discussions in the society. The goal of the medical-nursing integration model is to realize the integrated model of medical care-nursing-rehabilitation-old care, and to better satisfy the needs by providing medical services, rehabilitation care, and health management. The medical needs of the elderly can help the elderly maintain a healthy state; the elderly care needs can be better met through elderly care services, and the burden on families and society can be reduced. With the advancement of the medical-care integration model, new solutions have been provided for the management of senile dementia patients. Therefore, under the medical-care integration model, this paper managed Alzheimer's patients based on the big data algorithm based on association rules and compared it with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, and drew the following conclusions: compared with the management satisfaction of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, family members and patients' total satisfaction with nursing management under the medical-care integration model was greatly improved; compared with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, the incidence of adverse events in the management of Alzheimer's patients under the medical-care integration model was greatly reduced, which was reduced to 17.6%; under the medical-care integration model, the anxiety and depression scores of the elderly patients with dementia decreased rapidly; under the medical-care integration model, the living ability of senile dementia patients has been greatly improved; the use of the medical-care integration model to manage senile dementia patients has greatly improved the sleep quality, mental quality, and quality of life of senile dementia patients.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of incurable and debilitating diseases characterized by progressive degeneration and death of cells in the central nervous system. They have multiple underlying mechanisms; however, they all share common degenerative features, such as mitochondrial dysfunction. According to recent studies, neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Selective autophagy of mitochondria, called mitophagy, can specifically degrade excess or dysfunctional mitochondria within cells. In this review, we highlight recent findings on the role of mitophagy in neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple studies were collected, including those related to the importance of mitochondria, the mechanism of mitophagy in protecting mitochondrial health, and canonical and non-canonical pathways in mitophagy. This review elucidated the important function of mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases, discussed the research progress of mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases, and summarized the role of mitophagy-related proteins in neurological diseases. In addition, we also highlight pharmacological advances in neurodegeneration.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The standard Centiloid (CL) method was proposed to harmonize and quantify global 18F-labeled amyloid beta (A\u03b2) PET ligands using MRI as an anatomical reference. However, there is need for harmonizing and quantifying regional A\u03b2 uptakes between ligands using CT as an anatomical reference. In the present study, we developed and validated a CT-based regional direct comparison of 18F-florbetaben (FBB) and 18F-flutemetamol (FMM) Centiloid (rdcCL).For development of MRI-based or CT-based rdcCLs, the cohort consisted of 63 subjects (20 young controls (YC) and 18 old controls (OC), and 25 participants with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD)). We performed a direct comparison of the FMM-FBB rdcCL method using MRI and CT images to define a common target region and the six regional VOIs of frontal, temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, occipital, and striatal regions. Global and regional rdcCL scales were compared between MRI-based and CT-based methods. For clinical validation, the cohort consisted of 2245 subjects (627 CN, 933 MCI, and 685 ADD).Both MRI-based and CT-based rdcCL scales showed that FMM and FBB were highly correlated with each other, globally and regionally (R2 = 0.96~0.99). Both FMM and FBB showed that CT-based rdcCL scales were highly correlated with MRI-based rdcCL scales (R2 = 0.97~0.99). Regarding the absolute difference of rdcCLs between FMM and FBB, the CT-based method was not different from the MRI-based method, globally or regionally (p value = 0.07~0.95). In our clinical validation study, the global negative group showed that the regional positive subgroup had worse neuropsychological performance than the regional negative subgroup (p < 0.05). The global positive group also showed that the striatal positive subgroup had worse neuropsychological performance than the striatal negative subgroup (p < 0.05).Our findings suggest that it is feasible to convert regional FMM or FBB rdcSUVR values into rdcCL scales without additional MRI scans. This allows a more easily accessible method for researchers that can be applicable to a variety of different conditions.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "This study examines predictors of nursing home admission (NHA) in Belgium in order to contribute to a better planning of the future demand for nursing home (NH) services and health care resources.Data derived from the Belgian 2013 health interview survey were linked at individual level with health insurance data (2012 tot 2018). Only community dwelling participants, aged \u226565\u2009years at the time of the survey were included in this study (n\u00a0=\u20091930). Participants were followed until NHA, death or end of study period, i.e., December 31, 2018. The risk of NHA was calculated using a competing risk analysis.Over the follow-up period (median 5.29\u2009years), 226 individuals were admitted to a NH and 268 died without admission to a NH. The overall cumulative risk of NHA was 1.4, 5.7 and 13.1% at respectively 1\u2009year, 3\u2009years and end of follow-up period. After multivariable adjustment, higher age, low educational attainment, living alone and use of home care services were significantly associated with a higher risk of NHA. A number of need factors (e.g., history of falls, suffering from urinary incontinence, depression or Alzheimer's disease) were also significantly associated with a higher risk of NHA. On the contrary, being female, having multimorbidity and increased contacts with health care providers were significantly associated with a decreased risk of NHA. Perceived health and limitations were both significant determinants of NHA, but perceived health was an effect modifier on limitations and vice versa.Our findings pinpoint important predictors of NHA in older adults, and offer possibilities of prevention to avoid or delay NHA for this population. Practical implications include prevention of falls, management of urinary incontinence at home and appropriate and timely management of limitations, depression and Alzheimer's disease. Focus should also be on people living alone to provide more timely contacts with health care providers. Further investigation of predictors of NHA should include contextual factors such as the availability of nursing-home beds, hospital beds, physicians and waiting lists for NHA.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Semi-quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) measures (standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr)) have several advantages over quantitative measures, such as practical applicability and relative computational simplicity. However, semi-quantitative measures may potentially be affected by changes in blood flow, whereas quantitative measures such as binding potential (BPND) are not. For [18F]flortaucipir PET the sensitivity of SUVr for changes in blood flow has not been investigated yet. This is important, because [18F]flortaucipir PET is an important outcome measure in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore we compared semi-quantitative (SUVr) and quantitative (R1, BPND) parameters of longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir PET scans, and assessed their vulnerability to changes in blood flow. Subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; n = 38) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (n = 24) underwent baseline (BL) and 2-year follow-up (FU) dynamic [18F]flortaucipir PET scans. BPND and R1 were estimated using receptor parametric mapping (RPM) and SUVr(80-100min) was calculated. For each region-of-interest ((trans)entorhinal, limbic and neocortical) and parameter, %change was calculated. Regional SUVrs were compared to corresponding DVR (= BPND+1) using paired T-tests. Additionally, simulations were performed to model effects of (large(r)) flow changes on BPND and SUVr in different binding categories. Thereafter, %bias for SUVr with respect to underlying binding and flow were evaluated. Results in SCD and AD showed only minor differences between SUVr and BPND %change. R1 changes were small (+0.7% in SCD and -1.6% in AD). Simulations illustrated a variable %bias for SUVr depending on the underlying binding condition. Concluding, in line with established practices, SUVr provided an accurate estimate of specific binding for [18F]flortaucipir over a two-year follow-up during which changes in flow were small, also in AD patients. Notwithstanding, simulations showed that large(r) flow changes may potentially affect [18F]flortaucipir SUVr. Given that it is currently unknown to what order of magnitude pharmacotherapeutic interventions may induce changes in cerebral blood flow, caution may be warranted in situations where changes in flow are large(r) and DVR/BPND may be preferred in such conditions to ensure representative quantification of [18F]flortaucipir PET images.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurological disorder characterized by amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (hyper p-tau), neuronal damage, memory loss, etc. Various factors, such as age, lifestyle, family history, environmental factors, and gene mutation, cause AD. BACE-1 is an interesting target to prevent or reverse AD progression. BACE-1 cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) into soluble amyloid precursor protein \u03b2 (sAPP\u03b2) and membrane-bound C-terminal fragment called C99, a rate-limiting step, and C99 is further cleaved by gamma-secretase to generate neurotoxic amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2). Discovery and development of selective \u03b2 amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors have a great potential for the treatment and maintenance of Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we have compiled literature pertaining to guanidine-based novel BACE-1 inhibitors for the treatment and maintenance of AD. We have also discussed role of BACE-1 substrates, and its crystal structure, BACE-1 inhibitors in the clinical trial, and essential points to overcome challenges associated with selective development of BACE-1 inhibitors. This paper provides valuable information for the design and discovery of selective new BACE-1 inhibitors against other aspartyl protease enzymes to treat AD.",

The burden of neurological disorders was evaluated as incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost and years lived with disability.In 2019, DALYs of neurological diseases were 64.4\u2009million in South-East Asia (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 45.2 to 94.2) and 85.0\u2009million in Western Pacific regions (95% UI 63.0 to 118.5).

DALYs of stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, brain and central nervous system cancer, multiple sclerosis, migraine and tension-type headache increased in both regions in 2019 compared with 1990. Infectious diseases such as tetanus, meningitis and encephalitis decreased in both regions. DALYs of idiopathic epilepsy and motor neuron disease increased in the WHO South-East Asia region and decreased in the WHO Western Pacific region.This study demonstrated the burden of neurological diseases in Asia. To reduce the burden of neurological diseases, strategies suitable for each country's real healthcare needs and challenges are needed; this study can serve as the cornerstone of these strategies.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Several mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup association studies have suggested that common mtDNA variants are associated with multifactorial diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, such studies have also produced conflicting results. A new mtDNA association model, the 'variant load model' (VLM), has been applied to multiple disease phenotypes. Application of the VLM in a 2017 study failed to find different variant loads in AD patients compared to controls, in two cohorts of European origin. The study also suggested a lower variant load in healthy elderly individuals, but could offer no replicate cohort to support this observation. Here, the VLM is applied to Japanese mtDNA sequences; in doing so, we explored the role of mtDNA variation in AD and ageing in a different global population. Consistent with the previous findings using the VLM in two populations of European origin, we found no evidence for an association between rarer, non-haplogroup associated variation and the development of AD. However, the result in the context of ageing that suggested those with fewer mildly deleterious mutations might undergo healthier ageing, was not replicated. In contrast to our previous study, our present results suggest that those living to advanced old age may harbour more mildly deleterious mtDNA variations. Importantly our analysis showed this finding is not primarily being driven by many rare population variants dispersed across the mtDNA, but by a few more frequent variants with high MutPred scores. It is suggested the variants in question do not exert a mildly deleterious effect in their most frequent haplogroup context.",

We aim to assess all previously identified circulating microRNA signatures as potential biomarkers of genetic FTD and/or ALS, using homogeneous, independent validation cohorts of C9orf72 and GRN mutation carriers.104 individuals carrying a C9orf72 or a GRN mutation, along with 31 controls, were recruited through the French research network on FTD/ALS. All subjects underwent blood sampling, from which circulating microRNAs were extracted. We measured differences in the expression levels of 65 microRNAs, selected from 15 published studies about FTD or ALS, between 31 controls, 17 C9orf72 presymptomatic subjects, and 29 C9orf72 patients. We also assessed differences in the expression levels of 30 microRNAs, selected from five studies about FTD, between 31 controls, 30 GRN presymptomatic subjects, and 28 GRN patients.More than half (35/65) of the selected microRNAs were differentially expressed in the C9orf72 cohort, while only a small proportion (5/30) of microRNAs were differentially expressed in the GRN cohort. In multivariate analyses, only individuals in the C9orf72 cohort could be adequately classified (ROC AUC up to 0.98 for controls versus presymptomatic subjects, 0.94 for controls versus patients, and 0.77 for presymptomatic subjects versus patients) with some of the signatures.Our results suggest that previously identified microRNAs using sporadic or mixed cohorts of FTD and ALS patients could potentially serve as biomarkers of C9orf72-associated disease, but not GRN-associated disease.",

Consistent with prior work, brains with LATE-NC had more severe ADNC, more hippocampal sclerosis, and more brain arteriolosclerosis copathologies. Behavioral symptoms and cognitive performance on neuropsychological tests were compared, stratified by ADNC severity (low/intermediate vs high). Participants with ADNC and LATE-NC were older, had higher ADNC burden, and had worse cognitive performance than participants with ADNC alone. In the low/intermediate ADNC strata, participants with comorbid LATE-NC had higher prevalence of behavioral symptoms (apathy, disinhibition, agitation, personality change). They also had worsened performance in episodic memory and language/semantic memory. Differences narrowed in the high ADNC strata, with worsened performance in only episodic memory in the comorbid LATE-NC group. The co-occurrence of LATE-NC with ADNC is associated with a different pattern of behavioral and cognitive performance than ADNC alone, particularly in people with low/intermediate ADNC burden.",

This approach revitalizes the traditional drug discovery method by revealing new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. There are numerous studies available that highlight the triumph of several drugs as repurposed therapeutics. For example, sildenafil to aspirin, thalidomide to adalimumab, and so on. Millions of people worldwide are affected by neurodegenerative diseases. According to a 2021 report, the Alzheimer's disease Association estimates that 6.2 million Americans are detected with Alzheimer's disease. By 2030, approximately 1.2 million people in the United States possibly acquire Parkinson's disease. Drugs that act on a single molecular target benefit people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Current pharmacological approaches, on the other hand, are constrained in their capacity to unquestionably alter the course of the disease and provide patients with inadequate and momentary benefits. Drug repositioning-based approaches appear to be very pertinent, expense- and time-reducing strategies for the enhancement of medicinal opportunities for such diseases in the current era. Kinase inhibitors, for example, which were developed for various oncology indications, demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases.

The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the main route of TRP catabolism into nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+), and metabolites of this pathway may have protective or degenerative effects on the nervous system. Thus, the KP may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases.The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the changes in KP metabolites such as TRP, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), Anthranilic acid (AA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) patients compared to the control group.We conducted a literature search using PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and EMBASE electronic databases to find articles published up to 2022. Studies measuring TRP, KYN, KYNA, AA, 3-HK, 5-HIAA, 3-HANA in AD, PD, or HD patients and controls were identified. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used to determine the differences in the levels of the KP metabolites between the two groups.A total of 30 studies compromising 689 patients and 774 controls were included in our meta-analysis. Our results showed that the blood levels of TRP was significantly lower in the AD (SMD=-0.68, 95% CI=-0.97 to -0.40, p=0.000, I2 = 41.8%, k=8, n=382), PD (SMD=-0.77, 95% CI=-1.24 to -0.30, p=0.001, I2 = 74.9%, k=4, n=352), and HD (SMD=-0.90, 95% CI=-1.71 to\u00a0-0.10, p=0.028, I2 = 91.0%, k=5, n=369) patients compared to the controls. Moreover, the CSF levels of 3-HK in AD patients (p=0.020) and the blood levels of KYN in HD patients (p=0.020) were lower compared with controls.Overall, the findings of this meta-analysis support the hypothesis that the alterations in the KP may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and HD. However, additional research is needed to show whether other KP metabolites also vary in AD, PD, and HD patients. So, the metabolites of KP can be used for better diagnosing these diseases.",

The data of MR scanning of the brain, bilateral MRS scan of the hippocampus, thyroid function and other laboratory indicators, and neuropsychological evaluation analysis were collected in 50 patients who had been diagnosed with AD. According to CDR, 50 patients were divided into the early AD group and the middle and advanced AD group, with 23 patients in the early AD group and 27 patients in the middle and advanced AD group. Retrospective study was conducted to analyze the general conditions, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) grading, and the metabolic changes of bilateral MRS in the hippocampus of patients in both groups, so did the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), activities of daily living scale (ADL), and other neuropsychological assessment results. Moreover, the comparative analysis was carried out. The results showed that the MTA grade of medial temporal atrophy increased with the progressive severity of the disease in both groups. A statistical test was conducted on the reduction of hippocampal volume in the two groups, and the P was less than 0.05. Therefore, the MTA scale was of great value in the diagnosis and staging of early AD. However, when the diagnosis of early AD was treated by MTA visual evaluation alone, there was 23.8% false negative diagnosis. If the judgment of early AD only depended on the metabolic changes of hippocampus MRS or MR scanning of intracranial structures, it was likely to cause false negative diagnosis. Therefore, the combination of MRS analysis and MR scanning of intracranial structures was favorable for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Combined with neuropsychological assessment, AD patients were staged more effectively, which greatly improved the accuracy of AD diagnosis in the early stage.",

Less is known about the clinical features of AD patients with TBI history. The objective of this study was to examine whether a history of TBI and specific injury characteristics are associated with differences in age of disease onset, cognitive features, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in AD patients.Biomarker-proven AD patients (CSF or amyloid PET) were selected from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. TBI events were classified by age at injury (TBI <25 or \u226525 years) and TBI severity (loss of consciousness, multiple events). Cognitive composite scores were calculated from results of a neuropsychological test battery. NPSs were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Linear regression analyses were utilized to examine associations between TBI, TBI characteristics, and clinical outcome measures.Among the 1,755 selected AD patients (mean age = 65.2 years), 166 (9.5%) had documented \u22651 TBI in their medical history. Overall, TBI history was not related to differences in age of disease onset, but age at injury <25 years old was associated with 2.3 years earlier age at symptom onset (B = -2.34, p = 0.031). No significant associations were found between TBI history or TBI characteristics and differences in cognition or NPSs.Our results underscore previous findings on the vulnerability of the brain during critical maturation phases and suggest that an early TBI may contribute to lower resilience to neurodegenerative changes.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), neurogranin and the neurogranin/BACE1 ratio are proposed markers for Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 is also a drug target. However, CSF levels may differ between early-stage amyloid plaque formation (A) and later stage downstream tau-tangle pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N) and may be expressed as an A/T/N stage (e.g. A+/T-/N or A+/T+/N+). Whether BACE1 and neurogranin levels are persistent traits or change with disease progression is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CSF neurogranin and BACE1 concentrations differ between A/T/N stages, whether these change over time and correlate with memory decline. This may have implications for patient selection in future trials. We used CSF markers to determine A/T/N stage using amyloid beta42/40 ratio, p-tau181 and total-tau respectively in predementia Alzheimer's disease cases (n = 176) [including cases that progressed to dementia (n = 10)] and controls (n = 74) from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation cohort. We selected cases at the presumed early (A+/T-/N-, n = 86) and late stages (A+/T+/N+, n = 90) of the Alzheimer's disease continuum and controlled with normal markers (A-/T-/N-, n = 74). A subset of subjects in all A/T/N groups underwent repeat CSF sampling at approximately 2-year intervals up to 6 years from baseline. Using linear mixed models, longitudinal measurements of CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in A+/T-/N- and A+/T+/N+ as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls were performed. Next, we measured changes in CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in cases that progressed from A-/T-/N- to A+/T-/N- (n = 12), from A+/T-/N- to A+/T or N+ (n = 12), remained stable A+/T-/N- (n = 26), remained stable A+/T+/N+ (n = 28) compared with controls remaining stable A-/T-/N- (n = 33). Lastly, associations between these markers and memory decline were assessed. Compared with A-/T-/N- healthy controls, neurogranin was unaltered in A+/T-/N- (n.s.) but higher in A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001). In contrast, BACE1 was lower in A+/T-/N- (P < 0.05) and higher in A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001). The neurogranin/BACE1 ratio was increased in both A+/T-/N- (P < 0.05) and A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001) groups as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls and was more strongly associated with memory decline (b = -0.29, P = 0.0006) than neurogranin (b = -0.20, P = 0.002) and BACE1 (b = -0.13, P = 0.046). Neurogranin and BACE1 level differences remained stable over time not only within A/T/N groups but also in patients progressing to more pathological A/T/N stages (e.g. progressing from A+/T-/N- to A + T or N+) and in cases progressing to dementia. Our results suggest that neurogranin and BACE1 levels may differentiate pathomechanistic Alzheimer's disease subgroups, putatively with different options for treatment.",

Our aim was to test their utility in clinical practice, from a multicentric unselected prospective cohort where patients presented with a large spectrum of cognitive deficits or complaints.The MEMENTO cohort enrolled 2323 outpatients with subjective cognitive complaint (SCC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) consulting in 26 French memory clinics. Participants had neuropsychological assessments, MRI and blood sampling at baseline. CSF sampling and amyloid PET were optional. Baseline blood A\u03b242/40 ratio, total-tau, p181-tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured using a Simoa HD-X analyzer. An expert committee validated incident dementia cases during a 5-year follow-up period.Overall, 2277 individuals had at least one baseline blood biomarker available (n=357 for CSF subsample, n=649 for PET subsample), among whom 257 were diagnosed with clinical AD/mixed dementia during follow-up. All blood biomarkers but total-tau were mildly correlated with their equivalence in the CSF (r=0.33 to 0.46, p<0.0001) and were associated with amyloid-PET status (p<0.0001). Blood p181-tau was the best blood biomarker to identify amyloid-PET positivity (AUC=0.74 [95%CI=0.69-0.79]). Higher blood and CSF p181-tau and NfL concentrations were associated with accelerated time to AD dementia onset with similar incidence rates, whereas blood A\u03b242/40 was less efficient than CSF A\u03b242/40. Blood p181-tau alone was the best blood predictor of 5-year AD/mixed dementia risk (c-index=0.73 [95%CI=0.69-0.77]); its accuracy was higher in patients with CDR=0 (c-index=0.83 [95% CI=0.69;0.97]) than in patients with CDR=0.5 (c-index=0.70 [95% CI=0.66;0.74]). A \"clinical\" reference model (combining demographics and neuropsychological assessment) predicted AD/mixed dementia risk with a c-index=0.88 [95%CI=0.86-0.91] and performance increased to 0.90 [95%CI=0.88;0.92] when adding blood p181-tau+A\u03b242/40.

Chronic kidney disease and vascular comorbidities did not impact predictive performances.In a clinic-based cohort of patients with SCC or MCI, blood biomarkers may be good hallmarks of underlying pathology but add little to 5-year dementia risk prediction models including traditional predictors.",

Results The whole sample model (N\u00a0= 745) showed a good fit to the data. The direct effect of experiential avoidance on carer depression (\u03b2\u00a0= .10) and its indirect effect on carer depression through cognitive fusion (\u03b2\u00a0= .15) were significant. Examined variables accounted for 45% of the variance of depression. Multi-group path analysis confirmed the same pattern of indirect path across 3 countries, while the direct path was no longer significant in Spanish and UK samples.Conclusion These findings suggest that targeting cognitive fusion may be particularly critical in culturally diverse carers and pre-emptive efforts to reduce experiential avoidance using psychological techniques may be beneficial among family carers prone to cognitive fusion regardless of cultural differences.",

An antibody targeting A\u03b2 (aducanumab) was approved as an AD treatment; however, some A\u03b2 antibodies have been reported to accelerate, instead of ameliorating, cognitive decline in individuals with AD. Using conditional APP mutations in human neurons for perfect isogenic controls and translational relevance, we found that the APP-Swedish mutation in familial AD increased synapse numbers and synaptic transmission, whereas the APP deletion decreased synapse numbers and synaptic transmission. Inhibition of BACE1, the protease that initiates A\u03b2 production from APP, lowered synapse numbers, suppressed synaptic transmission in wild-type neurons, and occluded the phenotype of APP-Swedish-mutant neurons. Modest elevations of A\u03b2, conversely, elevated synapse numbers and synaptic transmission. Thus, the familial AD-linked APP-Swedish mutation under physiologically relevant conditions increased synaptic connectivity in human neurons via a modestly enhanced production of A\u03b2. These data are consistent with the relative inefficacy of BACE1 and anti-A\u03b2 treatments in AD and the chronic nature of AD pathogenesis, suggesting that AD pathogenesis is not simply caused by overproduction of toxic A\u03b2 but rather by a long-term effect of elevated A\u03b2 concentrations.",

However, the relationships between protein synthesis deregulation and ER stress/UPR, as well as their role in the altered homeostatic support of Alzheimer's disease (AD) astrocytes remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2\u03b1 and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker (EML) resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2\u03b1 without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2\u03b1 and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent. Next, we investigated the ability of 3xTg-AD astrocytes to support metabolism and function of other cells of the central nervous system. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from 3Tg-iAstro cells significantly reduced protein synthesis rate in primary hippocampal neurons. When added as a part of pericyte/endothelial cell (EC)/astrocyte 3D co-culture, 3Tg-iAstro, but not WT-iAstro, severely impaired formation and ramification of tubules, the effect, replicated by EML overexpression in WT-iAstro cells. Finally, a chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) rescued protein synthesis, p-eIF2\u03b1 levels in 3Tg-iAstro cells and tubulogenesis in pericyte/EC/3Tg-iAstro co-culture. Collectively, our results suggest that a PERK-independent, p-eIF2\u03b1-associated impairment of protein synthesis compromises astrocytic homeostatic functions, and this may be caused by the altered ER-mitochondria interaction.",

However, these diagnoses are not perfect, and additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help improve our understanding of AD as well as our ability to detect the disease. Accordingly, a large amount of research has been invested into innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a form of neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose AD; however, fMRI is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. Nonetheless, recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human neural networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI research, deep learning models can automatically denoise images and classify AD by detecting patterns in participants' brain scans. In this systematic review, we investigate how fMRI (specifically resting-state fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose AD. In turn, we outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the accuracy, strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep learning methods. In turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new researchers, suggest specific areas for future research, and highlight the potential of fMRI to aid AD diagnoses.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a major public health concern and is characterized by sustained hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and destruction of insulin-producing \u03b2 cells. One pathological hallmark of T2D is the toxic accumulation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregates. Monomeric hIAPP is a hormone normally co-secreted with insulin. However, increased levels of hIAPP in prediabetic and diabetic patients can lead to the formation of hIAPP protofibrils, which are toxic to \u03b2 cells. Current therapies fail to address hIAPP aggregation and current screening modalities do not detect it. Using a stabilizing capping protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be developed against a previously nonisolatable form of hIAPP protofibrils, which are protofibril specific and do not engage monomeric hIAPP. Shown here are two candidate mAbs that can detect hIAPP protofibrils in serum and hIAPP deposits in pancreatic islets in a mouse model of rapidly progressing T2D. Treatment of diabetic mice with the mAbs delays disease progression and dramatically increases overall survival. These results demonstrate the potential for using novel hIAPP protofibril-specific mAbs as a diagnostic screening tool for early detection of T2D, as well as therapeutically to preserve \u03b2 cell function and target one of the underlying pathological mechanisms of T2D.",

Concentrations of fourteen air pollutants were calculated at participants' home addresses during pregnancy and childhood using land-use-regression models. Structural brain images were collected at age 9-12 years to assess cortical and subcortical brain volumes. APOE status and PRS for AD were examined as genetic modifiers. Linear regression models were used to conduct single-pollutant and multi-pollutant (using the Deletion/Substitution/Addition algorithm) analyses with a two-way interaction between air pollution and each genetic modifier.Higher pregnancy coarse particulate matter (PMcoarse) and childhood polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposure was differentially associated with larger cerebral white matter volume in APOE \u03b54 carriers compared to non-carriers (29,485\u00a0mm3 (95% CI 6,189; 52,781) and 18,663\u00a0mm3 (469; 36,856), respectively). Higher pregnancy PMcoarse exposure was differentially associated with larger cortical grey matter volume in children with higher compared to lower PRS for AD (19436\u00a0mm3 (825, 38,046)).APOE status and PRS for AD possibly modify the association between air pollution exposure and brain structural morphology in preadolescents. Higher air pollution exposure is associated with larger cortical volumes in APOE \u03b54 carriers and children with a high PRS for AD. This is in line with typical brain development, suggesting an antagonistic pleiotropic effect of these genetic features (i.e., protective effect in early-life, but neurodegenerative effect in adulthood).

In addition, HAR significantly inhibits the kinase activity of MARK4 (IC50 value of 4.46\u00a0\u03bcM). Structural investigations suggested that HAR binds to the active site pocket and forms several non-covalent interactions with biologically important residues of MARK4. All-atom molecular dynamics simulation studies further advocated that the MARK4-HAR complex is stabilized throughout the trajectory of 200\u00a0ns and causes a little conformational change.

Delivery of biotherapeutics to the brain can be enabled through receptor-mediated transcytosis via proteins such as the transferrin receptor, although limitations such as the ability to use Fc-mediated effector function to clear pathogenic targets can introduce safety liabilities. Hence, novel delivery approaches with alternative clearance mechanisms are warranted.Binders that optimized transport across the BBB, known as transcytosis-enabling modules (TEMs), were identified using a combination of antibody discovery techniques and pharmacokinetic analyses. Functional activity of TEMs were subsequently evaluated by imaging for the ability of myeloid cells to phagocytose target proteins and cells.We demonstrated significantly enhanced brain exposure of therapeutic antibodies using optimal transferrin receptor or CD98 TEMs. We found that these modules also mediated efficient clearance of tau aggregates and HER2+ tumor cells via a non-classical phagocytosis mechanism through direct engagement of myeloid cells. This mode of clearance potentially avoids the known drawbacks of Fc\u03b3R-mediated antibody mechanisms in the brain such as the neurotoxic release of proinflammatory cytokines and immune cell exhaustion.Our study reports a new brain delivery platform that harnesses receptor-mediated transcytosis to maximize brain uptake and uses a non-classical phagocytosis mechanism to efficiently clear pathologic proteins and cells.

        "ArticleAbstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a major obstacle in developing specific diagnostic imaging agents for many neurological disorders. In this study we aimed to generate single domain anti-mouse transferrin receptor antibodies (anti-mTfR VHHs) to mediate BBB transcytosis as components of novel MRI molecular contrast imaging agents. Anti-mTfR VHHs were produced by immunizing a llama with mTfR, generation of a VHH phage display library, immunopanning, and in vitro characterization of candidates. Site directed mutagenesis was used to generate additional variants. VHH fusions with neurotensin (NT) allowed rapid, hypothermia-based screening for VHH-mediated BBB transcytosis in wild-type mice. One anti-mTfR VHH variant was fused with an anti-amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) VHH dimer and labeled with fluorescent dye for direct assessment of in vivo target engagement in a mouse model of AD-related A\u03b2 plaque pathology. An anti-mTfR VHH called M1 and variants had binding affinities to mTfR of <1nM to 1.52nM. The affinity of the VHH binding to mTfR correlated with the efficiency of the VHH-NT induced hypothermia effects after intravenous injection of 600 nmol/kg body weight, ranging from undetectable for nonbinding mutants to -6\u00b0C for the best mutants. The anti-mTfR VHH variant M1P96H with the strongest hypothermia effect was fused to the anti-A\u03b2 VHH dimer and labeled with Alexa647; the dye-labeled VHH fusion construct still bound both mTfR and A\u03b2 plaques at concentrations as low as 0.22 nM. However, after intravenous injection at 600 nmol/kg body weight into APP/PS1 transgenic mice, there was no detectible labeling of plaques above control levels. Thus, NT-induced hypothermia did not correlate with direct target engagement in cortex, likely because the concentration required for NT-induced hypothermia was lower than the concentration required to produce in situ labeling. These findings reveal an important dissociation between NT-induced hypothermia, presumably mediated by hypothalamus, and direct engagement with A\u03b2-plaques in cortex. Additional methods to assess anti-mTfR VHH BBB transcytosis will need to be developed for anti-mTfR VHH screening and the development of novel MRI molecular contrast agents.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder whose etiology continues to be discussed, to the point that there are different hypotheses that seek to clarify it, in addition to the fact that, given its multifactorial nature, there are different risk factors associated with its development. As regards diagnosis, advances in molecule detection techniques at femtomolar scales have allowed to distinguish between healthy and diseased subjects at relatively early stages, although there is still much to be done. Aducanumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted against A\u03b2, whose marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration has been questioned by the international medical community, given the controversial results in clinical trials. Approval of this antibody as a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease opens the door to continue using this type of treatments, but with different therapeutic targets, such as, for example, tau protein. Finally, given the population tendency towards longevity, conditions such as Alzheimer's disease are gaining epidemiological importance, which is why it is imperative to analyze and link what is being done in the social, familiar, clinical and research fields and, most importantly, to find those areas of opportunity for the benefit of the patient.La enfermedad de Alzheimer es un desorden neurodegenerativo cuya etiolog\u00eda a\u00fan se discute, al punto de que existen diferentes hip\u00f3tesis que pretenden esclarecerla; adem\u00e1s, dada su naturaleza multifactorial, existen diferentes factores de riesgo asociados a su desarrollo.

There are limited pharmaceutical interventions to treat AD, however, and most of the treatment options are not for cure or prevention, but rather to slow down the progression of the disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tactile stimulation (TS) on AD-like symptoms and pathology in APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, a mouse model of AD. The results show that TS reduces the AD-like symptoms on tests of cognition, motor, and anxiety-like behaviors and these improvements in behavior are associated with reduced AD pathology in APP mice. Thus, TS appears to be a promising noninvasive strategy for slowing the onset of dementia in aging animals.",

However, the relationship between the retina and other biomarkers of AD has been underresearched. We gathered and analyzed the literature about the relationship between retinal and cerebral alterations detected via neuroimaging in patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and preclinical AD.This systematic review followed the PRISMA Statement guidelines through the 27 items on its checklist. We searched in PubMed, BVS, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, using the keywords: Alzheimer's disease, optical coherence tomography, white matter, cortex, atrophy, cortical thickness, neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. We included articles that studied the retina in relation to neuroimaging in patients with AD, MCI, and preclinical AD. We excluded studies without OCT, without neuroimaging, clinical cases, opinion articles, systematic reviews, and animal studies.Of a total of 35 articles found, 23 were finally included. Although mixed results were found, most of these corroborate the relationship between retinal and brain disorders.More rigorous research is needed in the field, including homogenized, longitudinal, and prolonged follow-up studies, as well as studies that include all stages of AD. This will enable better understanding of the retina and its implications in AD, leading to the discovery of retinal biomarkers that reflect brain alterations in AD patients in an accessible and noninvasive manner.",

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (iPSC-microglia) are increasingly used as a model of AD, but the relevance of historical immune stimuli to model AD is unclear. We performed a detailed cross-comparison over time on the effects of combinatory stimulation of iPSC-microglia, and in particular their relevance to AD. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to measure the transcriptional response of iPSC-microglia after 24\u2005h and 48\u2005h of stimulation with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), either alone or in combination with ATP\u03b3S. We observed a shared core transcriptional response of iPSC-microglia to ATP\u03b3S and to LPS+IFN-\u03b3, suggestive of a convergent mechanism of action. Across all conditions, we observed a significant overlap, although directional inconsistency to genes that change their expression levels in human microglia from AD patients. Using a data-led approach, we identify a common axis of transcriptomic change across AD genetic mouse models of microglia and show that only LPS provokes a transcriptional response along this axis in mouse microglia and LPS+IFN-\u03b3 in human iPSC-microglia.

To find the common altered and driving molecules in both brain and the platelet, we performed an integrated analysis of our platelet omics and brain omics reported in the literature, and analyzed their correlations with AD-specific pathology and cognitive impairment. By integrating the gene and protein expression profiles from 269 AD patients, we deduced 239 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) appeared in both brain and the platelet, and 70.3% of them had consistent changes. Further analysis demonstrated that the altered brain and peripheral regulations were pinpointed into 10 imbalanced pathways. We also found that 117 DEPs, including ADAM10, were closely associated to the AD-specific \u03b2-amyloid and tau pathologies; and the changes of IDH3B and RTN1 had a potential diagnostic value for cognitive impairment analyzed by machine learning. Finally, we identified that HMOX2 and SERPINA3 could serve as driving molecules in neurodegeneration, and they were increased and decreased in AD patients, respectively. Together, this integrated brain and platelet omics provides a valuable resource for establishing efficient peripheral diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for AD.",

We conducted nearly 1400 differential expression comparisons to identify cell type-specific molecular alterations (e.g., case vs healthy control, sex-specific, apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54/\u03b54, and TREM2 mutations). Each comparison was followed by protein-protein interaction module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and omics-informed target and drug (over 700,000 perturbation profiles) screening. Over 400 cell-cell interaction analyses using 6000 ligand-receptor interactions were conducted to identify the cell-cell communication networks in AD.All results are integrated into TACA (https://taca.lerner.ccf.org/), a new web portal with cell type-specific, abundant transcriptomic information, and 12 interactive visualization tools for AD.We envision that TACA will be a highly valuable resource for both basic and translational research in AD, as it provides abundant information for AD pathobiology and actionable systems biology tools for drug discovery.We compiled an Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain cell atlas consisting of more than 1.1 million cells/nuclei transcriptomes from 26 data sets, covering major brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and cell types (e.g., neuron, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and microglia).We conducted over 1400 differential expression (DE) comparisons to identify cell type-specific gene expression alterations. Major comparison types are (1) AD versus healthy control; (2) sex-specific DE, (3) genotype-driven DE (i.e., apolipoprotein E [APOE] \u03b54/\u03b54\u00a0vs APOE \u03b53/\u03b53; TREM2R47H vs common variants) analysis; and (4) others.

In view of the proposed trans-synaptic spread of the \u03b1-synuclein pathology, investigating the disease only in this segregated fashion would be detrimental to our understanding of its progression. In this systematic review, we summarize findings on structural and functional brain connectivity in DLB, as connectivity measures may offer better insights on how the brain is affected by the spread of the pathology. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, and SCOPUS for relevant articles published up to November 1, 2021. Of 1215 identified records, we selected and systematically reviewed 53 articles that compared connectivity features between patients with DLB and healthy controls. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-positron emission computer tomography, and electroencephalography assessments of patients revealed widespread abnormalities within and across brain networks in DLB. Frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks and their connections to other brain regions featured the most consistent disruptions, which were also associated with core clinical features and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, graph theoretical measures revealed disease-related decreases in local and global network efficiency. This systematic review shows that structural and functional connectivity characteristics in DLB may be particularly valuable at early stages, before overt brain atrophy can be observed. This knowledge may help improve the diagnosis and prognosis in DLB as well as pinpoint targets for future disease-modifying treatments. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Intriguingly, despite the common presence of tau aggregates in these diseases the affected brain regions, clinical symptoms, and morphology, conformation, and isoform ratio present in tau aggregates varies widely. The tau-mediated disease mechanisms that drive neurodegenerative disease are still unknown. Tau interactome studies are critically important for understanding tauopathy. They reveal the interacting partners that define disease pathways, and the tau interactions present in neuropathological aggregates provide potential insight into the cellular environment and protein interactions present during pathological tau aggregation. Here we provide a combined analysis of 12 tau interactome studies of human brain tissue, human cell culture models and rodent models of disease. Together, these studies identified 2084 proteins that interact with tau in human tissue and 1152 proteins that interact with tau in rodent models of disease. Our combined analysis of the tau interactome revealed consistent enrichment of interactions between tau and proteins involved in RNA binding, ribosome, and proteasome function. Comparison of human and rodent tau interactome studies revealed substantial differences between the two species. We also performed a second analysis to identify the tau interacting proteins that are enriched in neurons containing granulovacuolar degeneration or neurofibrillary tangle pathology. These results revealed a timed dysregulation of tau interactions as pathology develops. RNA binding proteins, particularly HNRNPs, emerged as early disease-associated tau interactors and therefore may have an important role in driving tau pathology.",

However, most patient studies do not capture the earliest stages of disease development and offer limited opportunities for experimental intervention, so rarely yield complete mechanistic insights. The use of animal models relies on evolutionary conservation of pathways involved in disease and is limited by an inability to recreate human-specific processes. In vitro models that are derived from human pluripotent stem cells cultured in 3D have emerged as a new model system that could bridge the gap between patient studies and animal models. In this Review, we summarize how such organoid models can complement classical approaches to accelerate neurological research. We describe our current understanding of neurodevelopment and how this process differs between humans and other animals, making human-derived models of disease essential. We discuss different methodologies for producing organoids and how organoids can be and have been used to model neurological disorders, including microcephaly, Zika virus infection, Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, and neurodevelopmental diseases, such as Timothy syndrome, Angelman syndrome and tuberous sclerosis.

Associations were investigated between CSF GAP-43 and clinical diagnosis, A\u03b2/tau/neurodegeneration (AT(N)) status, CSF and blood biomarkers of AD, cognitive measurements and brain neuroimaging findings. CSF GAP-43 levels were increased in patients with AD dementia (mean, 6331.05\u00a0pg/ml) compared with the CN (mean, 5001.05\u00a0pg/ml) and MCI (mean, 5118.8\u00a0pg/ml) (P\u2009<\u20090.001) groups.

In this study, we have developed a new approach based on 3D deep convolutional neural networks to accurately differentiate mild Alzheimer's disease dementia from mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal individuals using structural MRIs. For comparison, we have built a reference model based on the volumes and thickness of previously reported brain regions that are known to be implicated in disease progression. We validate both models on an internal held-out cohort from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on an external independent cohort from The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). The deep-learning model is accurate, achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 85.12 when distinguishing between cognitive normal subjects and subjects with either MCI or mild Alzheimer's dementia. In the more challenging task of detecting MCI, it achieves an AUC of 62.45. It is also significantly faster than the volume/thickness model in which the volumes and thickness need to be extracted beforehand. The model can also be used to forecast progression: subjects with mild cognitive impairment misclassified as having mild Alzheimer's disease dementia by the model were faster to progress to dementia over time. An analysis of the features learned by the proposed model shows that it relies on a wide range of regions associated with Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that deep neural networks can automatically learn to identify imaging biomarkers that are predictive of Alzheimer's disease, and leverage them to achieve accurate early detection of the disease.",

The EEG signals were identified on their frequency ranges as delta (from 0.5 to 4\u00a0Hz), theta (from 4 to 7\u00a0Hz), alpha (from 8 to 12\u00a0Hz), beta (from 16 to 31\u00a0Hz), and gamma (from 36 to 90\u00a0Hz). Stress is a sense of emotional tension caused by several life events. For example, worrying about something, being under pressure, and facing significant challenges are causes of stress. The human body is affected by stress in various ways. It promotes inflammation, which affects cardiac health. The autonomic nervous system is activated during mental stress. Posttraumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer's disease are common brain stress disorders. Several methods have been used previously to identify stress, for instance, magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography and EEG. The EEG identifies the electrical activity in the human brain by applying small electrodes positioned on the scalp of the brain. It is a useful non-invasive method and collects feedback from stress hormones. In addition, it can serve as a reliable tool for measuring stress. Furthermore, evaluating human stress in real-time is complicated and challenging.

In this study, the comprehensive N-glycome and glycoproteome of the brain were determined in eleven functional brain regions some of them known to be affected with the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). N-Glycans throughout the regions were generally highly branched and highly sialofucosylated. Regional variations were also found with regards to the glycan types including high mannose and complex-type structures. Glycoproteomic analysis identified the proteins that differed in glycosylation in the various regions. To obtain the broader representation of glycan compositions, four subjects with two in their seventies and two in their nineties representing two Alzheimer disease subjects, one hippocampal sclerosis subject, and one subject with no cognitive impairment were analyzed. The four subjects were all glycomically mapped across 11 brain regions. Marked differences in the glycomic and glycoproteomic profiles were observed between the samples.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Age-related neurodegenerative diseases have in common the occurrence of cognitive impairment, a highly incapacitating process that involves the cholinergic neurotransmission system. The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ((-)-[18F]FEOBV) has recently demonstrated its high value to detect alterations of the cholinergic system in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy body. We present here the development of the new vesamicol derivative tracer (-)-(R,R)-5-[18F]fluorobenzovesamicol ((-)[18F]FBVM) that we compared to (-)[18F]FEOBV in the same experimental conditions. We show that: i) in vitro affinity for the VAChT was 50-fold higher for (-)FBVM (Ki\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nM) than for (-)FEOBV (Ki\u00a0=\u00a061\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0nM); ii) in vivo in rats, a higher signal-to-noise specific brain uptake and a lower binding to plasma proteins and peripheral defluorination were obtained for (-)[18F]FBVM compared to (-)[18F]FEOBV. Our findings demonstrate that (-)[18F]FBVM is a highly promising PET imaging tracer which could be sufficiently sensitive to detect in humans the cholinergic denervation that occurs in brain areas having a low density of VAChT such as the cortex and hippocampus.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The 2-pentadecyl-2-oxazoline (PEA-OXA) is a natural compound with protective action in neuro-inflammation. We have previously shown that PEA-OXA behaves as an \u03b12 adrenergic receptor (\u03b12AR) antagonist and a putative protean agonist on histamine H3 receptors. Recently, neuroinflammation and monoaminergic neurotransmission dysfunction has drawn particular attention in Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathophysiology. In this context, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the dual-acting PEA-OXA in an AD-like model in mice. A combined computational and experimental approach was used to evaluate the ability of PEA-OXA to bind \u03b12A-AR subtype, and to investigate the effects of PEA-OXA treatment on neuropathological (behavioural and functional) effects induced by soluble Amyloid \u03b2 1-42 (sA\u03b21-42) intracerebroventricular injection. Computational analysis revealed the PEA-OXA ability to bind the \u03b12A-AR, a pharmacological target for AD, in two alternative poses, one overlapping the Na+ binding site. In vivo studies indicated that chronic treatment with PEA-OXA (10\u00a0mg/kg, os) restored the cognitive (discriminative and spatial memory) deficits and social impairments induced by sA\u03b2 injection. Consistently, electrophysiological analysis showed a recovery of the long-term potentiation in the hippocampus (Lateral Entorhinal Cortex-Dentate Gyrus pathway), while neuroinflammation, i.e., increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and microglia cells density were reduced. These data provide the basis for further investigation of the pro-cognitive aptitude of PEA-OXA by proposing it as an adjuvant in the treatment in AD, for which the available pharmacological approaches remain unsatisfactory. Moreover, this study offers new future direction in research investigating the role of \u03b12AR in neuropsychiatric illness and therapies.",

Exploratory biomarkers were prespecified with the post hoc addition of plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and amyloid-\u03b2. Men and women aged 60 to 85 years with gradual and progressive change in memory function for at least 6 months were included. A total of 1955 participants were assessed for eligibility. Key eligibility criteria include Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 20 to 28 and elevated amyloid and intermediate tau levels.Randomized participants received donanemab or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.

Many factors are involved in this process, such as aberrant expression of miRNAs.Firstly, we analyzed two microarray datasets related to AD (GSE48552, GSE129053) to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs, and two miRNAs were selected for further validation. Dataset analysis showed that the expression of hsa-miR200a-3p and hsa-miR502-3p were up-regulated in AD. These findings were validated in plasma samples by qRT-PCR. ROC curve analysis showed that plasma levels of both miRNAs might discriminate the AD and healthy controls. In addition, in silico analysis revealed that the upregulation of these miRNAs could promote AD progression via affecting the expression of target molecules mainly ATF6 and dynactin.Totally, hsa-miR200a-3p and hsa-miR502-3p are upregulated in AD and their plasma levels can discriminate AD and healthy people, highlighting their potential as blood-based biomarker for AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), also known as \u03b2-secretase, is an aspartic protease. The sorting of this enzyme into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes regulates the BACE1-mediated cleavage of its substrates, however, the mechanisms underlying this targeting remain poorly understood. The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface. Of note, shedding of the extracellular domain of Sez6, a protein cleaved exclusively by BACE1, is reduced in NCAM2-deficient animals. These results indicate that the BACE1-generated fragment of NCAM2 regulates BACE1 activity by promoting the targeting of BACE1 to Rab11-positive endosomes.",

To determine acute systemic metabolic and inflammatory responses and corresponding changes in the brain, we used a high fat diet fed obese mouse model of prediabetes and cognitive impairment. We observed acute systemic changes in metabolic and inflammatory responses, with impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and alterations in peripheral immune cell populations. Central inflammatory changes included microglial activation in a pro-inflammatory environment with cGAS/STING activation. Blocking gap junctions in neuron-microglial co-cultures significantly decreased cGAS/STING activation.

Economic and cultural differences cause a urban-rural gap in medical resources. This multicenter survey aimed to investigate the real-world practice of disease treatment among people with AD.People with AD and their caregivers from 30 provincial regions in mainland China were enrolled from October 2020 to December 2020 to be surveyed for their treatment experience. Logistic regression was used to explore the factors that influence medication adherence in all areas, urban areas, and rural areas.In this survey, 1,427 participants came from urban areas, and 539 participants came from rural areas. Patients in urban areas were older (mean age 74 vs. 70, p = 0.001), less frequently had mild AD (36.0 vs. 52.1%, p < 0.001), and more often were cared for at professional institutions (8.8 vs. 3.2%, p < 0.001). In terms of pharmacotherapy, 77.8% of people accepted taking lifelong medication, whereas 61.3% of patients insisted on taking medications. Although 72.0% of rural people believed in taking lifelong medication, only 30.0% adhered to drug use. The major factors that influenced medication adherence for all patients with AD were regional distribution (p < 0.001, OR = 6.18, 95% CI: 4.93-7.74) and family earnings (p = 0.003, OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.07-1.38).

We address these issues by proposing a radically new perspective to frame AD and PD: they are different manifestations of one only disease we call \"Neurodegenerative Elderly Syndrome (NES)\". NES goes through three phases. The seeding stage, which starts years before clinical signs, and where the part of the brain-body affected by the initial \u03b1Syn and monoamine dysfunctions, influences the future possible progression of NES towards PD or AD. The compensatory stage, where the clinical symptoms are still silent thanks to compensatory mechanisms keeping monoamine concentrations homeostasis. The bifurcation stage, where NES becomes AD or PD.

The heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. It is known to regulate protein misfolding in a variety of diseases, including inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation and NFT formation in AD. As yet, the diagnostic molecular markers of AD remain unclear. Herein, we sought to investigate molecular markers of HSP70 family that can affect diagnosis and treatment in AD through computational analysis. In this study, the intersection between HSP70 family members and immune molecules was taken to screen immune-related HSP70 family genes. Based on the datasets from the NCBI-Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we found that the expression levels of HSPA1A and HSPA2 were significantly increased in AD samples, while HSPA8 significantly decreased. Surprisingly, the combination of the 3 hub genes had a good diagnosis of AD via receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Moreover, the clinical value of the 3 hub genes was further assessed by the Spearman correlation analysis with AD-related genes, \u03b2-secretase activity, and \u03b3-secretase activity. In terms of immune cell infiltration, we showed that the distribution of seven immune cell types (macrophages M2, neutrophils, T cells CD4 memory activated, macrophages M0, NK cells activated, plasma cells, and T cells follicular helper) was associated with the occurrence of AD by CIBERSORT. Furthermore, our data suggested that EP300, MYC, TP53, JUN, CREBBP, and ESR1 might be key transcription factors (TFs) for the 3 hub genes. In general, these findings suggest that HSPA1A, HSPA2, and HSPA8 are potential molecular biomarkers for prognosis among HSP70 family in AD, and it provides a new perspective on diagnostic and therapeutic targets for AD.",

The interaction of iron accumulation with \u03b1-syn and tau was further explored as an essential pathological mechanism of PDD. However, the links and mechanisms between these factors remain unclear. Studies have shown that the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases such as PDD are closely related to the separation of abnormal phases. Substances such as proteins can form droplets through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) under normal physiological conditions and even undergo further liquid-solid phase transitions to form solid aggregates under disease or regulatory disorders, leading to pathological phenomena. By analyzing the existing literature, we propose that LLPS is the crucial mechanism causing abnormal accumulation of \u03b1-syn, tau, and other proteins in PDD, and its interaction with iron metabolism disorder is the key factor driving ferroptosis in PDD. Therefore, we believe that LLPS can serve as one of the means to explain the pathological mechanism of PDD.

The CST and FAZ area were not different between male and female AD participants. Among controls, men had a thicker CST (P < 0.001) and smaller FAZ area (P\u00a0= 0.003) compared with women. The RNFL thickness, GCIPL thickness, and CVI were similar among male and female AD participants and controls.There may be a loss of the physiologic sex-related differences in retinal structure and microvasculature in those with AD compared with controls. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for these findings.",

Participant willingness to enroll in different types of preclinical AD trials is understudied and whether the FDA approval of aducanumab affected these attitudes is unknown.To evaluate preferences toward three preclinical AD trial scenarios and whether the FDA approval of aducanumab changed willingness to participate among potential trial participants.Through an electronic survey, we asked enrollees in a recruitment registry age 50-79 to rate their willingness (using a 6-point Likert scale) to enroll in three hypothetical preclinical AD trial scenarios: an in-clinic infused monoclonal antibody intervention, a home-infused monoclonal antibody intervention, and an oral BACE inhibitor intervention. We administered the survey before and after the FDA approval of aducanumab. We used a generalized estimating equation model to assess group differences in preference for the trial scenarios. We used a paired t-test to determine if willingness to participate (using total willingness across three scenarios as the outcome) changed after the FDA decision.At baseline, the mean participant willingness was highest in the in-clinic infusion scenario. There was no significant change in willingness to participate, overall, after the FDA decision. Participants who were independently aware of the FDA's decision (prior to the second survey) demonstrated reduced willingness to participate; participants unaware of the FDA decision demonstrated no change.Willingness to participate in preclinical AD trials may have been negatively affected by the FDA's decision to approve aducanumab among those aware of the decision.",

Although the anterior piriform cortex (aPC) is an important brain area involved in processing olfactory input, little is known about how its neuronal activity is affected in early-stage AD.To elucidate whether odor-induced electrophysiological responses are altered in the aPC of 3-5-month-old APP/PS1 mice.Using head-fixed multi-channel recording techniques in APP/PS1 AD mouse model to uncover potential aberrance of the aPC neuronal firing and local field potential (LFP) in response to vanillin.We show that the firing rate of aPC neurons evoked by vanillin is significantly reduced in conscious APP/PS1 mice. LFP analysis demonstrates reduced low- and high-gamma (\u03b3low,\u03b3high) oscillations during both the baseline and odor stimulation periods in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, according to spike-field coherence (SFC) analysis, APP/PS1 mice show decreased coherence between odor-evoked spikes and \u03b3low rhythms, while the coherence with \u03b3high rhythms and the \u0394SFC of the oscillations is unaffected. Furthermore, APP/PS1 mice show reduced phase-locking strength in the baseline period, such that there is no difference between baseline and odor-stimulation conditions. This contrasts markedly with wild type mice, where phase-locking strength decreases on stimulation.The abnormalities in both the neuronal and oscillatory activities of the aPC may serve as electrophysiological indicators of underlying olfactory decline in early AD.",

Restricted cubic splines and Cox regression models were performed to assess the relationship of eGFR with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD).We observed a U-shaped relationship between each eGFR and risk of all-cause dementia and VaD, with eGFRcys and eGFRcr-cys showing a closer linkage (peGFRcys <0.0001, peGFRcrhboxcys<0.0001 and peGFRcr\u200a=\u200a0.0001). Lower and supranormal eGFR were related to increased risk of all-cause dementia. Compared to the reference category of 90-104\u200aml/min/1.73 m2, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause dementia for eGFRcr-cys 30-59,<30, and \u2265105\u200aml/min/1.73 m2 were 1.26 (95% CI [1.05-1.50], p\u200a=\u200a0.012), 2.62 (95% CI [1.54-4.47], p\u200a< \u200a0.001), and 1.41 (95% CI [1.17-1.70], p\u200a< \u200a0.001).

This patient group is expected to continue to expand as life expectancy climbs. Current diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease are complex, unaffordable, and invasive without regard to diagnosis quality at early stages, which urgently calls for more technical improvements for diagnosis specificity. Optical coherence tomography or tomographic angiography has been shown to identify retinal thickness loss and lower vascular density present earlier than symptom onset in these patients. The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and shares anatomic and functional similarities with the brain. Ophthalmological examinations can be an efficient tool to offer a window into cerebral pathology with the merit of easy operation. In this review, we summarized the latest observations on retinal pathology in Alzheimer's disease and discussed the feasibility of retinal imaging in diagnostic prediction, as well as limitations in current retinal examinations for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.",

Studies were identified by searching across MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, OVID, SCOPUS, SCIELO, LILACS, and by cross-referencing. All studies that provide a first-level cognitive assessment for MCI and dementia with any touchscreen tools suitable to be used in the context of primary care were included.Forty-two studies reporting on 30 tools and batteries were identified. Substantial differences among the tools emerged, in terms of theoretical framework, clinical validity, and features related to the application in clinical practice. A small proportion of the tools are available in multiple languages. Only 7 out of the 30 tools have a multiple languages validation. Only two tools are validated in low-educated samples, e.g., IDEA and mSTS-MCI.General practitioners can benefit from touchscreen cognitive tools. However, easy requirements of the device, low dependence on the examiner, fast administration, and adaptation to different cultures and languages are some of the main features that we need to take into consideration when implementing touchscreen cognitive tools in the culture and language of underrepresented populations.",

A framework method of thematic analysis included coding, analytic matrices, and pattern mapping.40 participants included 9 PLWD, 16 current CPs, and 15 former CPs of decedents; 48% impacted by Alzheimer's disease dementia. While help from family, support groups and adult day centers, paid caregiving, and sensitive clinical care were invaluable to PLWD, CPs, or both, these supports were insufficient to navigate the extensive challenges. Disease-oriented sources of distress included symptoms, functional impairment and falls, uncertainty and loss, and inaccessible care. Social and relational challenges included constrained personal and professional opportunities. The obligation and toll of giving or receiving caregiving were challenging. Clinical care challenges for PLWD and/or CPs included care fragmentation, insufficient guidance to inform planning and need for expert interdisciplinary clinical care at home.Findings highlight the breadth and gravity of gaps, which surpass the disciplinary focus of either behavioral neurology or palliative care alone.

AD7c-NTP and other factors were further applied as biomarkers to develop a cognition risk prediction model.Compared with the control, OSA patients showed significantly lower MoCA scores and higher urinary AD7c-NTP concentrations, while the severe OSA group appeared more significant. The urinary AD7c-NTP level of the OSA cognitive impairment group was higher than that of the non-cognitive impairment group. The results of regression analysis showed that urinary AD7c-NTP level was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment in OSA patients. Based on urinary AD7c-NTP levels and other selected factors, a multimodal prediction model for assessing the risk of cognitive impairment in OSA patients was initially established.The increased urinary AD7c-NTP level could be used as a relevant peripheral biomarker of cognitive impairment in OSA patients. A model using urinary AD7c-NTP combined with other factors was developed and could accurately assess the cognition risk of OSA patients.",

MRI-visible PVS in basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semi-oval (CSO) were visually classified as: none/mild, moderate or frequent/severe. The association of PVS with brain FDG-PET was explored based on the burden of amyloid pathology, where a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) t-tau/A\u03b242 with the ratio\u22650.27 was defined as high amyloid pathology. Moreover, the relationships between PVS and cognitive performance variables (ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF) were studied.For participants with higher tau/A\u03b242 ratio, CSO-PVS severity was independently associated with lower FDG-PET. There were significant interaction effects between moderate or frequent/severe CSO-PVS and time on FDG decline in people with high amyloid pathology. The interaction between CSO-PVS and time (follow-up) was consistently associated with ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF decline in individuals with high amyloid pathology.The study established the differential utility of PVS in BG and CSO for predicting brain metabolism. These findings suggest that CSO-PVS serves as a contributing factor to brain metabolism and cognitive decline associated with amyloid pathology.",

To comprehensively evaluate brain iron deposition along with aging, PD-related neurodegeneration, from prodromal PD (pPD) to clinical PD (cPD), and AD-related neurodegeneration, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, a total of 726 participants from July 2013 to December 2020, including 100 young adults, 189 old adults, 184 pPD, 171 cPD, 31 MCI and 51 AD patients, were included. Quantitative susceptibility mapping data were acquired and used to quantify regional magnetic susceptibility, and the resulting spatial standard deviations were recorded. A general linear model was applied to perform the inter-group comparison. As a result, relative to young adults, old adults showed significantly higher iron deposition with higher spatial variation in all of the subcortical nuclei (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). pPD showed a high spatial variation of iron distribution in the subcortical nuclei except for substantia nigra (SN); and iron deposition in SN and red nucleus (RN) were progressively increased from pPD to cPD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). AD showed significantly higher iron deposition in caudate and putamen with higher spatial variation compared with old adults, pPD and cPD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and significant iron deposition in SN compared with old adults (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

According to the injection site of tracer, the PBM group was further divided into PBM-ipsilateral traced group (n=6) and PBM-contralateral traced group (n=6). Rats in the PBM group and the sham PBM group were exposed to the dura minimally invasively on the skull corresponding to the frontal cortical area reached by ISF drainage from caudate nucleus region. The PBM group was irradiated by using 630 nm red light (5-6 mW/cm2), following an irradiation of 5 min with a 2 min pause, and a total of 5 times; the sham PBM group was kept in the same position for the same time using the light without power. The negative control group was kept without any measure. After PBM, tracer was injected into caudate nucleus of each group. The changes of ISF drainage in caudate nucleus were observed according to the diffusion and distribution of tracer molecule by tracer-based magnetic resonance imaging, and the structural changes of brain extracellular space (ECS) were analyzed by diffusion rate in ECS-mapping (DECS-mapping) technique. Finally, parameters reflecting the structure of brain ECS and the drainage of ISF were obtained: volume fraction (\u03b1), tortuo-sity (\u03bb), half-life (T1/2), and DECS. The differences of parameters among different groups were compared to analyze the effect of PBM on brain ECS and ISF. One-Way ANOVA post hoc tests and independent sample t test were used for statistical analysis.The parameters including T1/2, DECS, and \u03bb were significantly different among the PBM-ipsilateral traced group, the PBM-contralateral traced group, and the sham PBM group (F=79.286, P < 0.001; F=13.458, P < 0.001; F=10.948, P=0.001), while there was no difference in the parameter \u03b1 of brain ECS among the three groups (F=1.217, P=0.324). Compared with the sham PBM group and the PBM-contralateral traced group, the PBM-ipsilateral traced group had a significant decrease in the parameter T1/2 [(45.45\u00b16.76) min vs. (76.01\u00b13.44) min, P < 0.001; (45.45\u00b16.76) min vs. (78.07\u00b14.27) min, P < 0.001], representing a significant acceleration of ISF drainage; the PBM-ipsilateral traced group had a significant increase in the parameter DECS [(4.51\u00b10.77)\u00d710-4 mm2/s vs. (3.15\u00b10.44)\u00d710-4 mm2/s, P < 0.001; (4.51\u00b10.77)\u00d710-4 mm2/s vs. (3.01\u00b10.38)\u00d710-4 mm2/s, P < 0.001], representing a significantly increased molecular diffusion rate of in the brain ECS; the PBM-ipsilateral traced group had a significant decrease in the parameter \u03bb (1.51\u00b10.21 vs. 1.85\u00b10.12, P=0.001; 1.51\u00b10.21 vs. 1.89\u00b10.11, P=0.001), representing a significant decrease in the degree of tortuosity in the brain ECS.PBM can regulate the brain ISF drainage actively, which may be one of the potential mechanisms of the effect of PBM therapy on AD. This study provides a new method for enhancing the brain function via ECS pathway.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Insufficiencies of the micronutrient thiamine (Vitamin B1) have been associated with inducing Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology. The hypometabolic state associated with chronic thiamine insufficiency (TI) has been demonstrated to be a contributor towards the development of amyloid plaque deposition and neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying TI induced AD pathology is still unresolved. Previously, we have established that TI stabilizes the metabolic stress transcriptional factor, Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). Utilizing neuronal hippocampal cells (HT22), TI-induced HIF1\u03b1 activation triggered the amyloidogenic cascade through transcriptional expression and increased activity of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1). Knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of HIF1\u03b1 during TI significantly reduced BACE1 and C-terminal Fragment of 99 amino acids (C99) formation. TI also increased the expression of the HIF1\u03b1 regulated pro-apoptotic protein, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19\u00a0kDa protein-interacting protein (BNIP3). Correspondingly, cell toxicity during TI conditions was significantly reduced with HIF1\u03b1 and BNIP3 knockdown. The role of BNIP3 in TI-mediated toxicity was further highlighted by localization of dimeric BNIP3 into the mitochondria and nuclear accumulation of Endonuclease G. Subsequently, TI decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced chromatin fragmentation. However, cell toxicity via the HIF1\u03b1/BNIP3 cascade required TI induced oxidative stress. HIF1\u03b1, BACE1 and BNIP3 expression was induced in 3xTg-AD mice after TI and administration with the HIF1\u03b1 inhibitor YC1 significantly attenuated HIF1\u03b1 and target genes levels in vivo. Overall, these findings demonstrate a critical stress response during TI involving the induction of HIF1\u03b1 transcriptional activity that directly promotes neurotoxicity and AD-like pathology.",

Nevertheless, there is scarce data about SCD as a potential harbinger of cerebrovascular pathology. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between SCD and cerebrovascular damage measured by neuroimaging markers.This study was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted in 3 databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) from origin to December 8th, 2021. Primary studies including cognitively unimpaired adults with SCD and neuroimaging markers of cerebrovascular damage (i.e., white matter signal abnormalities, WMSA) were selected. Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis of studies with a case-control design was performed.Of 241 articles identified, 21 research articles were selected. Eight case-control studies were included for the meta-analysis. A significant overall effect-size was observed for the mean WMSA burden in SCD relative to controls, where the WMSA burden was higher in SCD.Our findings show the potential usefulness of SCD as a harbinger of cerebrovascular disease in cognitively healthy individuals. Further research is needed in order to elucidate the role of SCD as a preclinical marker of vascular cognitive impairment.",

The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care was convened to tackle the growing global concern of dementia by identifying risk factors. It concluded, along with other studies, that diabetes as well as obesity and the metabolic syndrome more broadly, which are frequently comorbid, raise the risk of developing dementia. Type 2 diabetes is a modifiable risk factor; however, it is uncertain whether anti-diabetic drugs mitigate risk of developing dementia. Reasons are manifold but constitute a critical knowledge gap in the field. This review outlines studies of type 2 diabetes on risk of dementia, illustrating key concepts.

The risk/benefit trade-off of routine beta-blocker (BB) use in patients with HFrEF and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) has not been explored. This study aimed to determine the association between BB use and outcomes among patients with HFrEF and ADRD.Using a random 40% sample of Medicare Parts A, B, and D data we identified patients with \u22651 hospitalization for HFrEF between 2008 and 2018. Each patient was classified based on BB use prior to admission and after discharge. Outcomes include 90-day and 1-year mortality and readmission.Between 2008 and 2018, we identified 357,030 patients hospitalized with HFrEF; 12.7% had ADRD. Patients with HFrEF and ADRD had higher 90-day and 1-year mortality compared to patients with HFrEF-only. Among patients admitted on a BB, 60.5% of patients with HFrEF-only were continued on therapy after discharge, compared to 56.8% of patients with HFrEF and ADRD. Discontinuing BB was associated with a 2.2-fold higher risk of 90-day mortality (p\u00a0<\u20090.001) among patients with HF-only and a 2.- fold higher risk of 90-day mortality (p\u00a0<\u20090.001) among patients with HFrEF\u00a0+\u2009ADRD. Not starting a BB was associated with a 1.8-fold higher risk of 90-day mortality (p\u00a0<\u20090.001) among patients with HFrEF-only and a 1.7-fold higher risk of 90-day mortality (p\u00a0<\u20090.001) among patients with HFrEF\u00a0+\u2009ADRD. Similar risks were seen at 1\u00a0year.BB therapy is associated with significantly lower short and long-term mortality rates among all patients with HFrEF; the magnitude of these associated benefits appear at least as large in patients with HFrEF and ADRD compared to patients with HFrEF-only.",

The association between performance on the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) and incident MCR risk was computed using Cox models and reported as Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for demographic, comorbidity, and cognitive factors. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between postmortem AD pathology as well as non-AD pathology and olfactory function at the time of MCR diagnosis using linear regression models adjusted for sex, education, age at death, and time from diagnosis to death.There were 544 (48.6%) incident cases of MCR over a median follow-up of 3.94 years. Lower BSIT scores (poor olfaction) at baseline were associated with an increased risk of incident MCR (HR for a 1-point increase in BSIT score, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96) in fully adjusted models. Those with hyposmia (scores of \u22648 on the BSIT) at baseline (26.6%) were at increased risk of MCR (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.74) compared to those with normal olfactory function. A composite measure of global AD pathology as well as presence of Lewy body pathology were both inversely and independently associated with BSIT scores at the time of incident MCR diagnosis (n=118). \u03c4 tangle density, a specific component of AD pathology, was inversely associated with olfactory function and the correlation remained after controlling for mild cognitive impairment syndrome as well as presence of Lewy body pathology.The results provide evidence that olfactory dysfunction precedes MCR incidence and is related to Alzheimer pathology; providing a clinical approach to risk stratify as well as subtype MCR.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that neurodegenerative processes are involved here. We are investigating whether autoantibody-positive psychiatric syndromes differ from those that are autoantibody-negative in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurodegeneration markers.We retrospectively analyzed data from 167 psychiatric patients at the University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen from 2017 to 2020. We divided this patient cohort into two, namely antibody-positive and antibody-negative. We compared various clinical features, neurodegeneration markers, and their autoantibody status in CSF and serum. We then compared both cohorts' neurodegeneration markers to a representative Alzheimer cohort. We subdivided the patients into their diverse psychiatric syndromes according to the manual to assess and document psychopathology in psychiatry (the AMDP), and compared the neurodegeneration markers.Antibody-associated psychiatric syndromes do not appear to reveal significantly greater neurodegeneration than their antibody-negative psychiatric syndromes. 71% of antibody-positive patients fulfilled the criteria for a possible and 22% for a definitive autoimmune encephalitis. Our autoantibody-positive patient cohort's relative risk to develop an possible autoimmune encephalitis was 9%. We also noted that phosphorylated tau protein 181 (ptau 181) did not significantly differ between antibody-associated psychiatric syndromes and our Alzheimer cohort. The psycho-organic syndrome usually exhibits the most prominent neurodegeneration markers, both in antibody-positive and antibody-negative psychiatric patients.We did not find hints for neurodegenerative processes in our antibody-positive versus AD cohort considering total tau or amyloid markers. However, our findings indicate that the neurodegeneration marker ptau181 does not differ significantly between antibody-positive and Alzheimer cohorts, further suggesting axonal neurodegeneration in antibody-positive patients as AD patients have an elevated ptau181. The evidence we uncovered thus suggests that axonal neurodegeneration might affect patients suffering from autoantibody-associated psychiatric syndromes.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Since Alois Alzheimer described the pathology of Alzheimer's disease in 1907, an increasing number of studies have attempted to discover its causes and possible ways to treat it. For decades, research has focused on neuronal degeneration and the disruption to the neural circuits that occurs during disease progression, undervaluing in some extent the alterations to glial cells even though these alterations were described in the very first studies of this disease. In recent years, it has been recognized that different families of neuroglia are not merely support cells for neurons but rather key and active elements in the physiology and pathology of the nervous system. Alterations to different types of neuroglia (especially astroglia and microglia but also mature oligodendroglia and oligodendroglial progenitors) have been identified in the initial neuropathological changes that lead to dementia, suggesting that they may represent therapeutic targets to prevent neurodegeneration. In this review, based on our own studies and on the relevant scientific literature, we argue that a careful and in-depth study of glial cells will be fundamental to understanding the origin and progression of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we analyze the main issues regarding the neuroprotective and neurotoxic role of neuroglial changes, reactions and/or involutions in both humans with Alzheimer's disease and in experimental models of this condition.",

It starts as a moderate condition affecting areas of the brain that make it challenging to retain recently learned information, causes mood swings, and causes confusion regarding occasions, times, and locations. The most prevalent type of dementia, called Alzheimer's disease (AD), causes memory-related problems in patients. A precise medical diagnosis that correctly classifies AD patients results in better treatment. Currently, the most commonly used classification techniques extract features from longitudinal MRI data before creating a single classifier that performs classification. However, it is difficult to train a reliable classifier to achieve acceptable classification performance due to limited sample size and noise in longitudinal MRI data. Instead of creating a single classifier, we propose an ensemble voting method that generates multiple individual classifier predictions and then combines them to develop a more accurate and reliable classifier. The ensemble voting classifier model performs better in the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset for older adults than existing methods in important assessment criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. For the binary classification of with dementia and no dementia, an accuracy of 96.4% and an AUC of 97.2% is attained.",

APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice were subjected to 12 weeks of treadmill exercise, followed by spatial memory tests. After the behavioral study, the amyloid (A\u03b2) pathology, gut microbes and metabolites, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) displacement, and degree of neuroinflammation were analyzed. We found that this strategy of exercise enriched gut microbial diversity and alleviated neuroinflammation in the brain. Notably, exercise led to reductions in pathogenic bacteria such as intestinal Allobaculum, increases in probiotic bacteria such as Akkermansia, increased levels of intestine-brain barrier proteins, and attenuated LPS displacement. These results suggest that prolonged exercise can effectively modulate gut microbes and the intestinal barrier and thereby reduce LPS displacement and ultimately alleviate AD-related neuroinflammation.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The physiological or dietary advantages of germinated grains have been the subject of numerous discussions over the past decade. Around 23 million tons of oats are consumed globally, making up a sizeable portion of the global grain market. Oat seedlings contain more protein, beta-glucan, free amino acids, and phenolic compounds than seeds. The progressive neurodegenerative disorder of Alzheimer's is accompanied by worsening memory and cognitive function. A key indicator of this disorder is the unusual buildup of amyloid-beta protein (or A\u03b2) in human brains. In this context, oat seedling extract (OSE) has been identified as a new therapeutic candidate for AD, due to its antioxidant activity and AD-specific mechanism of action. This study directly investigated how OSE affected AD and its impacts by examining the cognitive function and exploring the inflammatory response mechanism. The dried oat seedlings were grounded finely with a grinder, inserted with 50% fermented ethanol 10 times (w/v), and extracted by stirring for 10 h at 45 \u00b0C. After filtering the extract by 0.22 um filter, some of it was used for UHPLC analysis. The results indicated that the treatment with OSE protects against A\u03b225-35-induced cytotoxicity in BV2 cells. Tg-5Xfad AD mice had strong deposition of A\u03b2 throughout their brains, while WT mice did not exhibit any such deposition within their brains. A drastic reduction was observed in terms of numbers, as well as the size, of A\u03b2 plaques within Tg-5Xfad AD mice exposed to OSE. This study indicated OSE's neuroprotective impacts against neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation induced by amyloid-beta. Our results suggest that OSE acts as a neuroprotective agent to combat AD-specific apoptotic cell death, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta accumulation, as well as synaptic dysfunction in AD mice's brains. Furthermore, the study indicated that OSE treatment affects JNK/ERK/p38 MAPK signaling, with considerable inhibition in p-JNK, p-p38, and p-ERK levels seen in the brain of OSE-treated Tg-5Xfad AD mice.",

This review underlines the importance of gut-derived metabolites and gut metabolic status as the main players in gut-brain crosstalk and their implications on the severity of neural conditions. Scientific evidence indicates that the administration of probiotic bacteria exerts beneficial and protective effects as reduced systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and inhibited neurodegeneration. The experimental results performed on animals, but also human clinical trials, show the importance of designing a novel microbiota-based probiotic dietary supplementation with the aim to prevent or ease the symptoms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or other forms of dementia or neurodegeneration.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques leading to oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and cell death is one of the most accepted pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pandanus amaryllifolius, commonly recognized as fragrant screw pine due to its characteristic smell, is widely distributed in Southeast Asia and is consumed as a food flavor. In search for potential anti-AD agents from terrestrial sources, P. amaryllifolius was explored for its in vitro anti-amyloidogenic and neuroprotective effects. Thioflavin T (ThT) assay and the high-throughput screening multimer detection system (MDS-HTS) assay were used to evaluate the extracts' potential to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregations and oligomerizations, respectively. The crude alcoholic extract (CAE, 50 \u03bcg/mL) and crude base extract (CBE, 50 \u03bcg/mL) obstructed the A\u03b2 aggregation. Interestingly, results revealed that only CBE inhibited the A\u03b2 nucleation at 100 \u03bcg/mL. Both CAE and CBE also restored the cell viability, reduced the level of reactive oxygen species, and reversed the mitochondrial dysfunctions at 10 and 20 \u03bcg/mL extract concentrations in A\u03b2-insulted SY-SY5Y cells. In addition, the unprecedented isolation of nicotinamide from P. amaryllifolius CBE is a remarkable discovery as one of its potential bioactive constituents against AD. Hence, our results provided new insights into the promising potential of P. amaryllifolius extracts against AD and further exploration of other prospective bioactive constituents.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Altered gut microbiota has been reported in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous research has suggested that specific bacterial species might be associated with the decline of cognitive function. However, the evidence was insufficient, and the results were inconsistent. To determine whether there is an alteration of gut microbiota in patients with MCI and AD and to investigate its correlation with clinical characteristics, the fecal samples from 94 cognitively normal controls (NC), 125 participants with MCI, and 83 patients with AD were collected and analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The overall microbial compositions and specific taxa were compared. The clinical relevance was analyzed. There was no significant overall difference in the alpha and beta diversity among the three groups. Patients with AD or MCI had increased bacterial taxa including Erysipelatoclostridiaceae, Erysipelotrichales, Patescibacteria, Saccharimonadales, and Saccharimonadia, compared with NC group (p &lt; 0.05), which were positively correlated with APOE 4 carrier status and Clinical Dementia Rating (correlation coefficient: 0.11~0.31, p &lt; 0.05), and negatively associated with memory (correlation coefficient: -0.19~-0.16, p &lt; 0.01). Our results supported the hypothesis that intestinal microorganisms change in MCI and AD.

The bipolar nature of A\u03b242 molecule results in its ability to assemble into distinct oligomers and higher aggregates, which may drive some of the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in AD. Agents targeting A\u03b242 or its aggregates, such as anti-A\u03b242 antibodies, can inhibit the aggregation of A\u03b242 and toxicity of A\u03b242 aggregates to neural cells to a certain extent. However, the epitope specificity of an antibody affects its binding affinity for different A\u03b242 species. Different antibodies target different sites on A\u03b242 and thus elicit different neuroprotective or cytoprotective effects. In the present review, we summarize significant information reflected by anti-A\u03b242 antibodies in different immunotherapies and propose an overview of the structure (conformation)-toxicity relationship of A\u03b242 aggregates.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Accumulated clinical and biomedical evidence indicates that the gut microbiota and their metabolites affect brain function and behavior in various central nervous system disorders. This study was performed to investigate the changes in brain metabolites and composition of the fecal microbial community following injection of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and donepezil treatment of A\u03b2-injected mice using metataxonomics and metabolomics. A\u03b2 treatment caused cognitive dysfunction, while donepezil resulted in the successful recovery of memory impairment. The A\u03b2 + donepezil group showed a significantly higher relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia than the A\u03b2 group. The relative abundance of 12 taxa, including Blautia and Akkermansia, differed significantly between the groups. The A\u03b2 + donepezil group had higher levels of oxalate, glycerol, xylose, and palmitoleate in feces and oxalate, pyroglutamic acid, hypoxanthine, and inosine in brain tissues than the A\u03b2 group. The levels of pyroglutamic acid, glutamic acid, and phenylalanine showed similar changes in vivo and in vitro using HT-22 cells. The major metabolic pathways in the brain tissues and gut microbiota affected by A\u03b2 or donepezil treatment of A\u03b2-injected mice were related to amino acid pathways and sugar metabolism, respectively. These findings suggest that alterations in the gut microbiota might influence the induction and amelioration of A\u03b2-induced cognitive dysfunction via the gut-brain axis. This study could provide basic data on the effects of A\u03b2 and donepezil on gut microbiota and metabolites in an A\u03b2-induced cognitive impairment mouse model.",

However, these interactions can have important consequences in the treatment of both Alzheimer's disease and cancer. As isoquinoline alkaloids include galanthamine, an approved drug for Alzheimer's disease, as well as some potentially useful compounds with cytostatic potential, 28 members from this category of alkaloids were selected for a complex screening of interactions with iron and copper at four pathophysiologically relevant pH and in non-buffered conditions (dimethyl sulfoxide) by spectrophotometric methods in vitro. With the exception of the salts, all the alkaloids were able to chelate ferrous and ferric ions in non-buffered conditions, but only five of them (galanthine, glaucine, corydine, corydaline and tetrahydropalmatine) evoked some significant chelation at pH 7.5 and only the first two were also active at pH 6.8. By contrast, none of the tested alkaloids chelated cuprous or cupric ions. All the alkaloids, with the exception of the protopines, significantly reduced the ferric and cupric ions, with stronger effects on the latter. These effects were mostly dependent on the number of free aromatic hydroxyls, but not other hydroxyl groups. The most potent reductant was boldine. As most of the alkaloids chelated and reduced the ferric ions, additional experimental studies are needed to elucidate the biological relevance of these results, as chelation is expected to block reactive oxygen species formation, while reduction could have the opposite effect.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "New resveratrol-thiophene and resveratrol-maltol hybrids were synthesized as cholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidants. As with photostability experiments, biological tests also found remarkable differences in the properties and behavior of thiophene and maltol hybrids. While resveratrol-thiophene hybrids have excellent inhibitory and antioxidant properties (similar to the activity of reference drug galantamine), maltols have been proven to be weaker inhibitors and antioxidants. The molecular docking of selected active ligands gave insight into the structures of docked enzymes. It enabled the identification of interactions between the ligand and the active site of both cholinesterases. The maltols that proved to be active cholinesterase inhibitors were able to coordinate Fe3+ ion, forming complexes of 1:1 composition. Their formation constants, determined by spectrophotometry, are very similar, lgK = 11.6-12.6, suggesting that Fe3+ binds to the common hydroxy-pyranone moiety and is hardly affected by the other aromatic part of the ligand. Accordingly, the characteristic bands in their individual absorption spectra are uniformly red-shifted relative to those of the free ligands. The crystal structures of two new resveratrol-maltol hybrids were recorded, giving additional information on the molecules' intermolecular hydrogen bonds and packing. In this way, several functionalities of these new resveratrol hybrids were examined as a necessary approach to finding more effective drugs for complicated neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Lobeline is an alkaloid derived from the leaves of an Indian tobacco plant (Lobelia inflata), which has been prepared by chemical synthesis. It is classified as a partial nicotinic agonist and has a long history of therapeutic usage ranging from emetic and respiratory stimulant to tobacco smoking cessation agent. The presence of both cis and trans isomers in lobeline is well known, and many studies on the relationship between the structure and pharmacological activity of lobeline and its analogs have been reported. However, it is a remarkable fact that no studies have reported the differences in pharmacological activities between the two isomers. In this article, we found that different degrees of isomerization of lobeline injection have significant differences in respiratory excitatory effects in pentobarbital sodium anesthetized rats. Compared with cis-lobeline injections, the respiratory excitatory effect was significantly reduced by 50.2% after administration of injections which contained 36.9% trans-lobeline. The study on the influencing factors of isomerization between two isomers shown that this isomerization was a one-way isomerism and only converted from cis to trans, where temperature was the catalytic factor and pH was the key factor. This study reports a new discovery. Despite the widespread use of ventilators, first-aid medicines such as nikethamide and lobeline has retired to second line, but as a nonselective antagonist with high affinity for a4b2 and a3b2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In recent years, lobeline has shown great promise as a therapeutic drug for mental addiction and nervous system disorders, such as depression, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Therefore, we suggest that the differences between two isomers should be concerned in subsequent research papers and applications.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Cells and tissues are continuously subject to environmental insults, such as heat shock and oxidative stress, which cause the accumulation of cytotoxic, aggregated proteins. We previously found that Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM) protects cells from stress-induced cell death by preventing abnormal generation of protein aggregates similar to the effect of small heat shock proteins (HSPs). Protein aggregates are often associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we sought to determine how FAIM protein dynamics change during cellular stress and how FAIM prevents the formation of amyloid-\u03b2 aggregates/fibrils, one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Here, we found that the majority of FAIM protein shifts to the detergent-insoluble fraction in response to cellular stress. A similar shift to the insoluble fraction was also observed in small heat shock protein (sHSP) family molecules, such as HSP27, after stress. We further demonstrate that FAIM is recruited to sHSP-containing complexes after cellular stress induction. These data suggest that FAIM might prevent protein aggregation in concert with sHSPs. In fact, we observed the additional effect of FAIM and HSP27 on the prevention of protein aggregates using an in vitro amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation model system. Our work provides new insights into the interrelationships among FAIM, sHSPs, and amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation.",

Although previous studies have reported the role of zinc in animal physiology, little is known about the importance of zinc in the Golgi apparatus and ER in animal development and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we demonstrated that ZnT86D, a Drosophila ortholog of ZnT7, plays a pivotal role in the neurodevelopment and pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). When ZnT86D was silenced in neurons, the embryo-to-adult survival rate, locomotor activity, and lifespan were dramatically reduced. The toxic phenotypes were accompanied by abnormal neurogenesis and neuronal cell death. Furthermore, knockdown of ZnT86D in the neurons of a Drosophila AD model increased apoptosis and exacerbated neurodegeneration without significant changes in the deposition of amyloid beta plaques and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Taken together, our results suggest that an appropriate distribution of zinc in the Golgi apparatus and ER is important for neuronal development and neuroprotection and that ZnT7 is a potential protective factor against AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Beta-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) is a ligand associated with RAGE (Advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor). A\u03b2 is translocated in complexes with RAGE from the blood to brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by transcytosis. A\u03b2 and its isoforms are important factors in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, interaction with RAGE was previously studied for A\u03b2 but not for its isoforms. The present study has been directed at identifying the key interaction interfaces between RAGE and A\u03b2 isoforms (A\u03b240, A\u03b242, phosphorylated and isomerized isoforms pS8-A\u03b242, isoD7-A\u03b242). Two interfaces have been identified by docking: they are represented by an extended area at the junction of RAGE domains V and C1 and a smaller area linking C1 and C2 domains. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that all A\u03b2 isoforms form stable and tightly bound complexes. This indicates that all A\u03b2 isoforms potentially can be transported through the cell as part of a complex with RAGE. Modeling of RAGE interaction interfaces with A\u03b2 indicates which chemical compounds can potentially be capable of blocking this interaction, and impair the associated pathogenic cascades. The ability of three RAGE inhibitors (RAP, FPS-ZM1 and RP-1) to disrupt the RAGE:A\u03b2 interaction has been probed by docking and subsequently the complexes' stability verified by MD. The RP-1 and A\u03b2 interaction areas coincide and therefore this inhibitor is very promising for the RAGE:A\u03b2 interaction inhibition.",

Biomarkers are vital for diagnostics of brain disease and therapeutic monitoring. A biomarker can be objectively measured and evaluated as a proxy indicator for the pathophysiological process or response to therapeutic interventions. There are complex hurdles in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of neurological disorders and the ability to diagnose them at initial stages. Novel biomarkers for neurological diseases may surpass these issues, especially for early identification of disease risk. Validated biomarkers can measure the severity and progression of both acute neuronal injury and chronic neurological diseases such as epilepsy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and other brain diseases. Biomarkers are deployed to study progression and response to treatment, including noninvasive imaging tools for both acute and chronic brain conditions. Neuronal biomarkers are classified into four core subtypes: blood-based, immunohistochemical-based, neuroimaging-based, and electrophysiological biomarkers. Neuronal conditions have progressive stages, such as acute injury, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and neurogenesis, which can serve as indices of pathological status. Biomarkers are critical for the targeted identification of specific molecules, cells, tissues, or proteins that dramatically alter throughout the progression of brain conditions. There has been tremendous progress with biomarkers in acute conditions and chronic diseases affecting the central nervous system.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Dysregulated brain cholesterol metabolism is one of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is a cholesterol metabolite that plays an essential role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and it is suggested that it contributes to AD-related cognitive deficits. However, the link between 27-OHC and cholesterol homeostasis, and how this relationship relates to AD pathogenesis, remain elusive. Here, 12-month-old ApoE \u03b54 transgenic mice were injected with saline, 27-OHC, 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole, ANS), and 27-OHC+ANS for 21 consecutive days. C57BL/6J mice injected with saline were used as wild-type controls. The indicators of cholesterol metabolism, synaptic structure, amyloid \u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b21-42), and learning and memory abilities were measured. Compared with the wild-type mice, ApoE \u03b54 mice had poor memory and dysregulated cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, damaged brain tissue and synaptic structure, cognitive decline, and higher A\u03b21-42 levels were observed in the 27-OHC group. Moreover, cholesterol transport proteins such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein1 (LRP1) were up-regulated in the cortex after the 27-OHC treatment. The levels of cholesterol metabolism-related indicators in the hippocampus were not consistent with those in the cortex. Additionally, higher serum apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) levels and lower serum ApoE levels were observed in the 27-OHC group. Notably, ANS partially reversed the effects of 27-OHC. In conclusion, the altered cholesterol metabolism induced by 27-OHC was involved in A\u03b21-42 deposition and abnormalities in both the brain tissue and synaptic structure, ultimately leading to memory loss in the ApoE \u03b54 transgenic mice.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "A common symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is cognitive decline, of which the potential pathogenesis remains unclear. In order to understand the mechanism of gut microbiota in AD, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolites. Behavioral tests, pathological examination, metagenomics, and metabolomics were applied to analyze the difference of gut microbiota and metabolome between APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 (PAP) mice with cognitive decline and age-matched controls, and their possible correlations. Our results showed that PAP mice and health mice had different structures of the bacterial communities in the gut. The abundances and diversities of the bacterial communities in health mice were higher than in PAP mice by metagenomics analysis. The abundances of Libanicoccus massiliensis, Paraprevotella clara, and Lactobacillus amylovorus were significantly increased in PAP mice, while the abundances of Turicibacter sanguinis, Dubosiella newyorkensis, and Prevotella oris were greatly reduced. Furthermore, PAP mice possessed peculiar metabolic phenotypes in stool, serum, and hippocampus relative to WT mice, as is demonstrated by alterations in neurotransmitters metabolism, lipid metabolism, aromatic amino acids metabolism, energy metabolism, vitamin digestion and absorption, and bile metabolism. Microbiota-host metabolic correlation analysis suggests that abnormal metabolism in stool, serum, and hippocampus of PAP mice may be modulated by the gut microbiota, especially T. sanguinis, D. newyorkensis, and P. oris. Therefore, abnormal metabolism activity is associated with gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease mice. Our results imply that modifying host metabolism through targeting gut microbiota may be a novel and viable strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD in the future.",

In Alzheimer's disease, and other related tauopathies, the pattern of tau deposition follows a stereotypical progression between anatomically connected brain regions. Increasing evidence suggests that tau behaves in a \"prion-like\" manner, and that seeding and spreading of pathological tau drive progressive neurodegeneration. Although several advances have been made in recent years, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Since there are no effective therapies for any tauopathy, there is a growing need for reliable experimental models that would provide us with better knowledge and understanding of their etiology and identify novel molecular targets. In this review, we will summarize the development of cellular models for modeling tau pathology. We will discuss their different applications and contributions to our current understanding of the \"prion-like\" nature of pathological tau.",

Currently approved single-target drugs cannot effectively ameliorate AD. Medicinal herbs and their derived ingredients (MHDIs) have multitarget and multichannel properties, engendering exceptional AD treatment outcomes. This review delineates how in in vivo models MHDIs suppress A\u03b2 deposition by downregulating \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase activities; inhibit oxidative stress by enhancing the antioxidant activities and reducing lipid peroxidation; prevent tau hyperphosphorylation by upregulating protein phosphatase 2A expression and downregulating glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 expression; reduce inflammatory mediators partly by upregulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2-mediated signaling and downregulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated signaling; attenuate synaptic dysfunction by increasing presynaptic protein, postsynaptic protein, and acetylcholine levels and preventing acetylcholinesterase activity; and protect against neuronal apoptosis mainly by upregulating Akt/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling and downregulating p38 MAPK/JNK/Bcl-2-associated x protein (Bax)/caspase-3-, Bax/apoptosis-inducing factor-, C/EBP homologous protein/glucose-regulated protein 78-, and autophagy-mediated apoptotic signaling. Therefore, MHDIs listed in this review protect against A\u03b2-induced cognitive decline by inhibiting A\u03b2 accumulation, oxidative stress, tau hyperphosphorylation, inflammation, synaptic damage, and neuronal apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus during the early and late AD phases.",

As a result, elderly patients with early stage AD may require interventions that are more cognitively intense than traditional interventions. To address this need, in this multiple case study, we explored a dual-task-based music therapy intervention that involved drum playing and singing designed to induce attentional and motor controls. Three octogenarians diagnosed with early stage AD participated in 12 dual-task-based music therapy sessions over 6 weeks. Measures of executive functioning and the performance of a bimanual drum tapping task were evaluated before and after the intervention. Improvements in executive functioning were observed for participants A and C. After the intervention, reduced mean synchronization errors were found for the simultaneous tapping condition for all three participants. Although there was variability in the functional changes between participants, it is noteworthy that positive improvements in the elderly patients with early stage AD were obtained following dual-task-based music therapy. The results suggest that music therapy integrated into the dual-task paradigm can be an effective way to address degenerative cognitive deficits among elderly patients with early stage AD.",

Here, we recapitulate the general concepts of mechanobiology and the mechanisms that govern the mechanosensing and mechanotransduction processes, and we examine the crosstalk between mechanical stimuli and intracellular biochemical response, highlighting their effect on cellular organelles' homeostasis and dysfunction. In particular, we discuss the current knowledge about the translation of mechanosignaling into biochemical signaling, focusing on those diseases that encompass metabolic accumulation of mutant proteins and have as primary characteristics the formation of pathological intracellular aggregates, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease.

Notable progress in the previous decades has generated many lines of proof arguing that yeast, fungal, and mammalian prions determine heritable as well as infectious traits. The extraordinary phenotypic diversity of human prion diseases arises from structurally distinct prion strains that target, at different progression speeds, variable brain structures and cells. Although human prion research presents beneficial lessons and methods to study the mechanism of strain diversity of protein-only pathogens, the fundamental molecular mechanism by which tau conformers are formed and replicate in diverse tauopathies is still poorly understood.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurologic deficits associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection impact about 50% of persons with HIV (PWH). These disorders, termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), possess neuropathologic similarities to Alzheimer's disease (AD), including intra- and extracellular amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide aggregates. A\u03b2 peptide is produced through cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta secretase BACE1. However, this is precluded by cleavage of APP by the non-amyloidogenic alpha secretase, ADAM10. Previous studies have found that BACE1 expression was increased in the CNS of PWH with HAND as well as animal models of HAND. Further, BACE1 contributed to neurotoxicity. Yet in in vitro models, the role of ADAM10 and its potential regulatory mechanisms had not been examined. To address this, primary rat cortical neurons were treated with supernatants from HIV-infected human macrophages (HIV/MDMs). We found that HIV/MDMs decreased levels of both ADAM10 and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a regulator of ADAM10 that is implicated in aging and in AD. Both decreases were blocked with NMDA receptor antagonists, and treatment with NMDA was sufficient to induce reduction in ADAM10 and SIRT1 protein levels. Furthermore, decreases in SIRT1 protein levels were observed at an earlier time point than the decreases in ADAM10 protein levels, and the reduction in SIRT1 was reversed by proteasome inhibitor MG132. This study indicates that HIV-associated insults, particularly excitotoxicity, contribute to changes of APP secretases by downregulating levels of ADAM10 and its regulator.",

In this study we used 22 AD large-scale gene expression datasets to identify a consistent underlying portrait of AD gene expression across multiple brain regions. Then we used the portrait as a platform for identifying treatments that could reverse AD dysregulated expression patterns. Enrichment of dysregulated AD genes included multiple processes, ranging from cell adhesion to CNS development. The three most dysregulated genes in the AD portrait were the inositol trisphosphate kinase, ITPKB (upregulated), the astrocyte specific intermediate filament protein, GFAP (upregulated), and the rho GTPase, RHOQ (upregulated). 41 of the top AD dysregulated genes were also identified in a recent human AD GWAS study, including PNOC, C4B, and BCL11A. 42 transcription factors were identified that were both dysregulated in AD and that in turn affect expression of other AD dysregulated genes. Male and female AD portraits were highly congruent. Out of over 250 treatments, three datasets for exercise or activity were identified as the top three theoretical treatments for AD via reversal of large-scale gene expression patterns. Exercise reversed expression patterns of hundreds of AD genes across multiple categories, including cytoskeleton, blood vessel development, mitochondrion, and interferon-stimulated related genes. Exercise also ranked as the best treatment across a majority of individual region-specific AD datasets and meta-analysis AD datasets. Fluoxetine also scored well and a theoretical combination of fluoxetine and exercise reversed 549 AD genes. Other positive treatments included curcumin. Comparisons of the AD portrait to a recent depression portrait revealed a high congruence of downregulated genes in both. Together, the AD portrait provides a new platform for understanding AD and identifying potential treatments for AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Both plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (pTau181) and tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) show potential for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and predicting clinical progression. In this study, we performed a head-to-head comparison between plasma pTau181 and tau-PET along the AD continuum. Methods: We included participants from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort that underwent 18F-flortaucipir (tau)-PET and had a plasma sample biobanked within 12-months from tau-PET. Fifty subjective cognitive decline (SCD) participants (31 A\u03b2-negative and 19 A\u03b2-positive) and 60 A\u03b2-positive participants with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD (MCI/AD) were included. A subset had 2-year longitudinal plasma pTau181 and tau-PET available (n = 40). Longitudinal neuropsychological test data covering 3.2 \u00b1 2.7 years from both before and after tau-PET was available. Plasma pTau181 and tau-PET were compared in their accuracies in discriminating between cognitive stage (MCI/AD versus SCD) and preclinical A\u03b2-status (SCD A\u03b2-positive versus SCD A\u03b2-negative), their associations with cross-sectional and longitudinal neuropsychological test performance, and their longitudinal changes over time. Results: When discriminating between preclinical A\u03b2-status, the area under the curve (AUC) for plasma pTau181 (AUC: 0.83) and tau-PET (AUCs: entorhinal: 0.87; temporal: 0.85; neocortical: 0.67) were equally high (all DeLong's p>0.05), but tau-PET outperformed plasma pTau181 in discriminating MCI/AD from SCD (AUC plasma pTau181: 0.74; AUCs tau-PET: entorhinal: 0.89; temporal: 0.92; neocortical: 0.89) (all p<0.01). Overall, tau-PET showed stronger associations with cognitive decline and was associated with a wider variety of cognitive tests compared to plasma pTau181 (\u03b2-range plasma pTau181: -0.02>\u03b2<-0.12; \u03b2-range tau-PET: -0.01>\u03b2<-0.22). Both plasma pTau181 and tau-PET increased more steeply over time in MCI/AD compared to SCD (p<0.05), but only tau-PET annual changes associated with cognitive decline. Conclusion: Our results suggest that plasma pTau181 and tau-PET perform equally well in identifying A\u03b2 pathology, but tau-PET better monitors disease staging and clinical progression.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and currently there are no available treatments. Alongside the conventional A\u03b2 and tau hypotheses, neuroinflammation and metabolism disruption have also been regarded as crucial hallmarks of AD. In this study, a novel Chinese formula Nao Tan Qing (NTQ) was developed and shown to improve AD. In vivo experiments showed that NTQ significantly mitigated cognitive impairment, A\u03b2 burden and neuroinflammation in a transgenic AD mouse model (5\u00d7FAD). Network pharmacology results revealed that the active components of NTQ could target inflammatory and metabolic pathways. In addition, hippocampal transcriptomics suggested that NTQ regulated signaling pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Consistently, serum metabolomics further indicated that NTQ could modulate glycolipid metabolism. In summary, a combination of systems pharmacology analysis and biological validation study demonstrates that NTQ could alleviate behavioral abnormality and pathological alterations of AD by targeting glycolipid metabolism and neuroinflammation, and is accordingly a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Glial activation and related neuroinflammatory processes play a key role in the aging and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CHI3L1/ YKL40 is a widely investigated chitinase in neurodegenerative diseases and recent studies have shown its involvement in aging and AD. Nevertheless, the biological function of CHI3L1 in AD is still unknown. Here, we collected microarray datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) brain samples of not demented healthy controls (NDHC) who died from causes not attributable to neurodegenerative disorders (n\u00a0=\u00a0460), and of deceased patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n\u00a0=\u00a0697). The NDHC and AD patients were stratified according to CHI3L1 expression levels as a cut-off. We identified two groups both males and females, subsequently used for our statistical comparisons: the high CHI3L1 expression group (HCEG) and the low CHI3L1 expression group (LCEG). Comparing HCEG to LCEG, we attained four signatures according to the sex of patients, in order to identify the healthy and AD brain cellular architecture, performing a genomic deconvolution analysis. We used neurological signatures (NS) belonging to six neurological cells populations and nine signatures that included the main physiological neurological processes. We discovered that, in the brains of NDHC the high expression levels of CHI3L1 were associated with astrocyte activation profile, while in AD males and females we showed an inflammatory profile microglia-mediated. The low CHI3L1 brain expression levels in NDHC and AD patients highlighted a neuronal activation profile. Furthermore, using drugs opposing CHI3L1 transcriptomic signatures, we found a specific drug profile for AD males and females characterized by high levels of CHI3L1 composed of fostamatinib, rucaparib, cephaeline, prednisolone, and dinoprostone. Brain levels of CHI3L1 in AD patients represent a biological signature that allows distinguishing between males and females and their likely cellular brain architecture.",

How to promote cognitive function among persons with chronic stroke is unclear.To evaluate the effect of exercise (EX) or cognitive and social enrichment activities (ENRICH) on cognitive function in adults with chronic stroke.This was a 3-group parallel, single-blinded, single-site, proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial at a research center in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Participants included community-dwelling adults with chronic stroke, aged 55 years and older, able to walk 6 meters, and without dementia. The trial included a 6-month intervention and a 6-month follow-up. Randomization occurred from June 6, 2014, to February 26, 2019. Measurement occurred at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Data were analyzed from January to November 2021.Participants were randomly allocated to twice-weekly supervised classes of: (1) EX, a multicomponent exercise program; (2) ENRICH, a program of cognitive and social enrichment activities; or (3) balance and tone (BAT), a control group that included stretches and light-intensity exercises.The primary outcome was the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive-Plus (ADAS-Cog-Plus), which included the 13-item ADAS-Cog, Trail Making Test Parts A and B, Digit Span Forward and Backward, Animal Fluency, and Vegetable Fluency.One-hundred and twenty participants, with a mean (range) of 1.2 (1-4) strokes, a mean (SD) of 66.5 (53.8) months since the most recent stroke, mean (SD) baseline age of 70 (8) years, mean (SD) baseline ADAS-Cog-Plus of 0.22 (0.81), and 74 (62%) male participants, were randomized to EX (34 participants), ENRICH (34 participants), or BAT (52 participants). Seventeen withdrew during the 6-month intervention and another 7 during the 6-month follow-up. Including all 120 participants, at the end of the 6-month intervention, EX significantly improved ADAS-Cog-Plus performance compared with BAT (estimated mean difference: -0.24; 95% CI, -0.43 to -0.04; P\u2009=\u2009.02). This difference did not persist at the 6-month follow-up (estimated mean difference: -0.08; 95% CI, -0.29 to 0.12; P\u2009=\u2009.43). For the 13-item ADAS-Cog, the EX group improved by 5.65 points over the 6-month intervention (95% CI, 2.74 to 8.57 points; P\u2009<\u2009.001), exceeding the minimally clinical difference of 3.0 points.These findings suggest that exercise can induce clinically important improvements in cognitive function in adults with chronic stroke.

Novel small molecular compound 2JY-OBZ4 is one of structural analogue of Huperzine A (Hup-A), an anti-AD drug in China. In our previous work, 2JY-OBZ4 exhibited potent effects on tau hyperphosphorylation, A\u03b2 production and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. However, 2JY-OBZ4's anti-AD effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We here reported that 2JY-OBZ4 resisted tau hyperphosphorylation at Thr181 and Ser396 sites in HEK293-hTau cells transfected with GSK-3\u03b2, decreased tau phosphorylation via upregulating the activity of PP2A in HEK293-hTau cells and reduced A\u03b2 production through regulating protein levels of APP cleavage enzymes in N2a-hAPP cells. Meanwhile, we found that 2JY-OBZ4 had no adverse effects on cell viability of mice primary neuron even at high concentration, and ameliorated synaptic loss induced by human oligomeric A\u03b242. 2JY-OBZ4 had moderate AChE inhibitory activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) to be 39.48 \u03bcg/ml in vitro, which is more than two times higher than Hup-A. Together, 2JY-OBZ4 showed promising therapeutic effects in AD cell models through regulating multiple targets. The research provides a new candidate for the therapeutic development of AD.",

By thresholding the RRC matrix (with a threshold of 0.15), a graph adjacency matrix was created to compute GTMs.Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis: parametric multivariable statistical analysis (PMSA) with a false discovery rate using (FDR)-corrected P\u00a0<\u20090.05 cluster-level threshold together with posthoc uncorrected P\u00a0<\u20090.05 connection-level threshold. Graph-theory analysis (GTA): P-FDR-corrected\u2009<\u20090.05. One-way ANOVA and Chi-square tests were used to compare clinical characteristics.PMSA differentiated AD from normal, with a significant decrease in FC of default mode, salience, dorsal attention, frontoparietal, language, visual, and cerebellar networks. Furthermore, significant increase in overall FC of visual and language networks was observed in aMCI compared to normal. GTA revealed a significant decrease in global-efficiency (28.05\u2009<\u200945), local-efficiency (22.98\u2009<\u200924.05), and betweenness-centrality (14.60\u2009<\u200917.39) for AD against normal.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has been proposed to be driven by an abnormal neuroinflammatory response affecting cognitive function. However, the impact of T2DM on hippocampal function and synaptic integrity during aging has not been investigated. Here, we investigated the effects of aging in T2DM on AD-like pathology using the leptin receptor-deficient db/db mouse model of T2DM. Our results indicate that adult T2DM mice exhibited impaired spatial acquisition in the Morris water maze (MWM). Morphological analysis showed an age-dependent neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus. We found that astrocyte density was significantly decreased in all regions of the hippocampus in T2DM mice. Our\u00a0analysis showed that microglial activation was increased in the CA3 and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in an age-dependent manner in T2DM mice. However, the expression of presynaptic marker protein (synaptophysin) and the postsynaptic marker protein [postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95)] was unchanged in the hippocampus of adult T2DM mice. Interestingly, synaptophysin and PSD95 expression significantly decreased in the hippocampus of aged T2DM mice, suggesting an impaired hippocampal synaptic integrity. Cytokine profiling analysis displayed a robust pro-inflammatory cytokine profile in the hippocampus of aged T2DM mice compared with the younger cohort, outlining the role of aging in exacerbating the neuroinflammatory profile in the diabetic state. Our results suggest that T2DM impairs cognitive function by promoting neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus and triggering an age-dependent deterioration in hippocampal synaptic integrity, associated with an aberrant neuroinflammatory response.",

Our study covered a population of 144 patients versus 90 healthy controls matched with each other in terms of age, gender, age of onset, etc. All patients underwent neurological examination, comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Controls were selected based on the neurological examination and the Arabic version of the minimental state examination (MMSE). Patients were classified as probable typical amnestic AD and atypical nonamnestic AD if the patient had logopenic variant primary aphasia, posterior cortical atrophy, behavioural or dysexecutive variants, corticobasal syndrome, nonfluent and semantic variants of primary progressive aphasia associated to biological diagnosis for AB42, Tau and Ptau biomarks in the cerebrospinal fluid. Genotyping was performed using the polymerace chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The study of the allelic frequency of APOE in cases and controls show that APOE \u03b54 is associated with an increased risk for AD (P = 0.002). We observed that the distribution of APOE \u03b54 within the AD group differs depending on the phenotype. Nonamnestic AD was more common in patients not carrying APOE \u03b54 (APOE \u03b54 (-)) compared to carriers of homozygous or heterozygous APOE \u03b54 (APOE \u03b54 (+)) (P = 0.038).

The aim of our study was to investigate the survival and causes of death of DLB.The patients diagnosed with probable DLB were consecutively enrolled from five memory clinics in China across a 5-year period (2017-2021) with mortality data updated to December 2021. The endpoint was all-cause death. Survival analysis including Cox regression by groups (time both from disease onset and the first visit to death) and causes of death were evaluated.Of the 108 patients with DLB, 54 (50%) were men and the time from onset of disease to the first visit to the memory clinic (lag time) was 24 (12-48) months. During follow-up, 28.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a031) of the patients died.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Efficient identification of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in early stages of the AD disease continuum is a critical unmet need. Subjective cognitive decline is increasingly recognized as an early symptomatic stage of AD. Dyadic cognitive report, including subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) from a participant and an informant/study partner who knows the participant well, represents an accurate, reliable, and efficient source of data for assessing risk. However, the separate and combined contributions of self- and study partner report, and the dynamic relationship between the two, remains unclear. The Subjective Cognitive Decline Professional Interest Area within the Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment convened a working group focused on dyadic patterns of subjective report. Group members identified aspects of dyadic-report information important to the AD research field, gaps in knowledge, and recommendations. By reviewing existing data on this topic, we found evidence that dyadic measures are associated with objective measures of cognition and provide unique information in preclinical and prodromal AD about disease stage and progression and AD biomarker status. External factors including dyad (participant-study partner pair) relationship and sociocultural factors contribute to these associations. We recommend greater dyad report use in research settings to identify AD risk. Priority areas for future research include (1) elucidation of the contributions of demographic and sociocultural factors, dyad type, and dyad relationship to dyad report; (2) exploration of agreement and discordance between self- and study partner report across the AD syndromic and disease continuum; (3) identification of domains (e.g., memory, executive function, neuropsychiatric) that predict AD risk outcomes and differentiate cognitive impairment due to AD from other impairment; (4) development of best practices for study partner engagement; (5) exploration of study partner report as AD clinical trial endpoints; (6) continued development, validation, and optimization, of study partner report instruments tailored to the goals of the research and population.",

However, the association between antibiotics and dementia incidence has rarely been studied. We aimed to determine the association between antibiotic exposure and the risk of dementia. Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study used data from the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) in South Korea. Exposure was the cumulative days of antibiotic prescription from 2002 to 2005. Newly diagnosed overall dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) were identified based on diagnostic codes and prescriptions for dementia-related drugs. The follow-up investigation was carried out from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. The Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between cumulative antibiotic prescription days and dementia incidence. Results: A total of 313,161 participants were analyzed in this study. Compared to antibiotic non-users, the participants who used antibiotics for 91 or more days had an increased risk of overall dementia [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.74], AD (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.17-1.81), and VD (aHR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.83-2.30). Those who used five or more antibiotic classes had higher risks of overall dementia (aHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.66) and AD (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.00-1.78) than antibiotic non-users. Conclusion: Antibiotic exposure may increase the risk of dementia in a cumulative duration-dependent manner among adult participants.

However, studies remain limited to older cohorts wherein pathologies of both dementia (e.g. amyloid) and SVD (e.g. white matter hyperintensities) already co-exist. In younger asymptomatic adults, we investigated differential associations and interactions of modifiable and non-modifiable inherited risk factors of (future) late-life dementia to (present-day) mid-life SVD.Cognitively healthy middle-aged adults (aged 40-59; mean 51.2\u00a0years) underwent 3T MRI (n = 630) as part of the PREVENT-Dementia study. To assess SVD, we quantified white matter hyperintensities, enlarged perivascular spaces, microbleeds, lacunes, and computed composite scores of SVD burden and subtypes of hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Non-modifiable (inherited) risk factors were APOE4 status and parental family history of dementia. Modifiable risk factors were derived from the 2020 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention (early/midlife: education, hypertension, obesity, alcohol, hearing impairment, head injuries). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the latent variables of SVD and risk factors. Structural equation modelling (SEM) of the full structural assessed associations of SVD with risk factors and APOE4*risk interaction.In SEM, the latent variable of global SVD related to the latent variable of modifiable midlife risk SVD (\u03b2 = 0.80, p = .009) but not non-modifiable inherited risk factors of APOE4 or family history of dementia. Interaction analysis demonstrated that the effect of modifiable risk on SVD was amplified in APOE4 non-carriers (\u03b2 = -\u20090.31, p = .009), rather than carriers. These associations and interaction effects were observed in relation to the SVD subtype of hypertensive arteriopathy, rather than CAA. Sensitivity analyses using separate general linear models validated SEM results.Established modifiable risk factors of future (late-life) dementia related to present-day (mid-life) SVD, suggesting that early lifestyle modifications could potentially reduce rates of vascular cognitive impairment attributed to SVD, a major 'silent' contributor to global dementia cases. This association was amplified in APOE4 non-carriers, suggesting that lifestyle modifications could be effective even in those with genetic predisposition to dementia.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Transcriptomic profiling of sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifested before age 65 is commonly referred to as early-onset AD (EOAD) (Reitz et al. Neurol Genet. 2020;6:e512). While the majority (>\u200990%) of EOAD cases are not caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, they do have a higher heritability (92-100%) than sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD, 70%) (Wingo et al. Arch Neurol. 2012;69:59-64, Fulton-Howard et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2021;99:101.e1-101.e9). Although the endpoint clinicopathological changes, i.e., A\u03b2 plaques, tau tangles, and cognitive decline, are common across EOAD and LOAD, the disease progression is highly heterogeneous (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). This heterogeneity, leading to temporally distinct age at onset (AAO) and stages of cognitive decline, may be caused by myriad combinations of distinct disease-associated molecular mechanisms. We and others have used transcriptome profiling in AD patient-derived neuron models of autosomal-dominant EOAD and sporadic LOAD to identify disease endotypes (Caldwell et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2020;6:eaba5933,\u00a0Mertens et al. Cell Stem Cell. 2021;28:1533-1548.e6, Caldwell et al. Alzheimers Demen. 2022). Further, analyses of large postmortem brain cohorts demonstrate that only one-third of AD patients show hallmark disease endotypes like increased inflammation and decreased synaptic signaling (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). Areas of the brain less affected by AD pathology at early disease stages-such as the primary visual cortex-exhibit similar transcriptomic dysregulation as those regions traditionally affected and, therefore, may offer a view into the molecular mechanisms of AD without the associated inflammatory changes and gliosis induced by pathology (Haroutunian et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2009;30:561-73). To this end, we analyzed AD patient samples from the primary visual cortex (19 EOAD, 20 LOAD) using transcriptomic signatures to identify patient clusters and disease endotypes. Interestingly, although the clusters showed distinct combinations and severity of endotypes, each patient cluster contained both EOAD and LOAD cases, suggesting that AAO may not directly correlate with the identity and severity of AD endotypes.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early and prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with impaired energy metabolism preceding the onset of clinical symptoms. Here we propose an update to the mitochondrial dysfunction hypothesis of AD based on recent results examining the role of mitochondrial genome abundance in AD. In a large post mortem study, we show that lower brain mitochondrial genome abundance is associated with a greater odds of AD neuropathological change and worse cognitive performance. We hypothesize that lower mitochondrial genome abundance impairs mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial bioenergetics, thereby impacting neuronal and glial cell function. However, it remains to be determined if mitochondrial dysfunction causes, mediates, or is a by-product of AD pathogenesis. Additional support for this hypothesis will be generated by linking peripheral blood mitochondrial genome abundance to AD and establishing clinical trials of compounds that upregulate total mitochondrial genome abundance or boost mitochondrial mass.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "In healthy adults, autobiographical memories (AMs) evoked by music appear to have unique cognitive characteristics that set them apart from AMs evoked by other cues. If this is the case, we might expect music cues to alleviate AM deficits in clinical disorders. This systematic review examines music-evoked autobiographical memories (MEAMs) in clinical populations, focusing on cognitive characteristics, and whether MEAMs differ from AMs evoked by other stimuli. We identified 15 studies featuring participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant - Frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), acquired brain damage, and depression. We found that music evokes AMs in these disorders, and that familiar music was more likely to evoke AMs. Compared with healthy controls, AD participants had a relative advantage for MEAMs over picture-evoked AMs. People with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex showed preserved access to MEAMs in terms of frequency, but a relative disadvantage regarding the episodic richness for MEAMs, but not for memories cued by pictures, compared to controls. Participants with bv-FTD had fewer AMs evoked after both music and pictures than healthy controls. Across conditions, MEAMs were generally specific and retrieved fast, suggesting little retrieval effort. MEAMs were also positive, except in depression, where as many negative as positive AMs were produced. These findings suggest several underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms of MEAMs, including anxiety reduction, increased fluency, music-evoked emotions, reminiscence, and involuntary retrieval, and that these might be moderated by musical abilities and memory for music. In conclusion, MEAMs appear to be relatively well preserved, especially in AD. This article is categorized under: Psychology > Memory.",

Fusing the benzylpiperidine motif from AChE inhibitor donepezil and the 1,2,4-oxadiazole core from the Nrf2 activator 25 that was previously reported, we designed and synthesized a series of multifunctional anti-AD hybrids. The optimal hybrid 15a exhibited excellent AChE inhibitory (eeAChE IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM; hAChE IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0\u03bcM) and significant Nrf2 inductivity. It upregulated the protein and transcription level of Nrf2 and its downstream proteins HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM and promoted Nrf2 translocation from cytoplasm into nuclei. Additionally, 15a exhibited important neuroprotective function in protecting the cells from being damaged by H2O2 and A\u03b21-42 aggregation and exerted antioxidant stress and anti-inflammatory activities in reducing the production of ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, 15a effectively shortened the latency time and escape distance to the target, increased the arrival times, and simplified the tracks in Morris water maze test induced by scopolamine and A\u03b21-42. At the same time, it significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory factors in the mice model brains. These effects of 15a in improving cognition and alleviating inflammation were even better than the combination of AChE inhibitor and Nrf2 activator, suggesting a remarkable benefit for AD treatment. 15a could serve as a novel hit compound with Nrf2 inductive activity and AChE inhibitory activity for further research.",

The neuropathological diagnosis is based on the concurrence of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) designated as Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. However, NFTs develop in the brain decades before the appearance of SPs, and their distribution does not parallel the distribution of SPs. Moreover, NFTs are found in about 85% of individuals at age 65 and around 97% at age 80. SPs occur in 30% at age 65 and 50%-60% at age 80. More than 70 genetic risk factors have been identified in sAD; the encoded proteins modulate cell membranes, synapses, lipid metabolism, and neuroinflammation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) overture provides a new concept and definition of brain aging and sAD for further discussion. AD overture proposes that sAD is: (i) a multifactorial and progressive neurodegenerative biological process, (ii) characterized by the early appearance of 3R\u2009+\u20094Rtau NFTs, (iii) later deposition of \u03b2-amyloid and SPs, (iv) with particular non-overlapped regional distribution of NFTs and SPs, (v) preceded by or occurring in parallel with molecular changes affecting cell membranes, cytoskeleton, synapses, lipid and protein metabolism, energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, cell cycle, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessels; (vi) accompanied by progressive neuron loss and brain atrophy, (vii) prevalent in human brain aging, and (viii) manifested as pre-clinical AD, and progressing not universally to mild cognitive impairment due to AD, and mild, moderate, and severe AD dementia.",

Early in their clinical course, PSP and CBS may be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson disease and several other illnesses, but it is crucial to do so because of implications for management and prognosis.Early accurate diagnosis of PSP and CBS remains a challenge because of heterogeneity in presenting symptoms and high frequency of coexisting pathologies (especially Alzheimer disease and vascular disease). It is increasingly recognized that patients with PSP, CBS, and other parkinsonian disorders require multidisciplinary care for optimal outcomes. With the recent proliferation of biomarker studies and therapeutic trials for tauopathies, there is growing hope that better treatments for PSP and CBS are on the horizon.Although PSP and CBS currently lack disease-modifying therapies, it is important to diagnose them as early as possible so that the patient can benefit from the many available symptomatic therapies, support groups, and a growing number of clinical trials.",

Unidimensionality and internal consistency of the CFI were examined using factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and McDonald's omega. Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to examine the performance of CFI.The CFI demonstrated adequate internal consistency; however, the fit for a unidimensional model was suboptimal. The CFI distinguished MCI from NC alone or in combination with MoCA. ROC analysis showed comparable performance of the CFI and the MoCA.Our findings support the use of CFI as a brief and easy-to-use screen to detect MCI in culturally/linguistically diverse older adults.What is the key scientific question or problem of central interest of the paper? Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) are considered the earliest sign of dementia in older adults. However, it is unclear if SCC are equivalent in different cultures. The Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) is a 14-item measure of SCC. This study provides pilot data suggesting that CFI is sensitive for detecting mild cognitive impairment in a cohort of older adults with racial/ethnic diversity. Comparing performance, CFI demonstrates comparable sensitivity to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, an objective cognitive screening test. Overall, SCC may provide a non-invasive, easy-to-use method to flag possible cognitive impairment in both research and clinical settings.",

Molecular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are now part of the established diagnostic tools for the clinical investigation of cognitive disorders in the elderly. Biomarkers allow for earlier and more accurate differential diagnosis, and are recommended by the Swiss Memory Clinics as an additional investigation based upon individual indication. Information and counselling are needed both before and after biomarker-supported diagnosis. The procedures for diagnostic lumbar punctures and pre-analytical sample handling should follow published recommendations. The results must be interpreted in the context of the other available history and assessment outcome. Thanks to recent research progress, blood-based biomarkers and other non-invasive markers are expected to become available for clinical practice in the near future. This trend will likely lead to a much broader utilisation of biomarkers and may accelerate the development of effective and individually tailored prevention and treatment approaches. This review article provides an overview over the current state of biomarkers and provides the recommendations of the Swiss Memory Clinics for their use in clinical practice.Zusammenfassung.

We sought to understand the differences in neuronal SEV miRNA expression between frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy aging. Plasma was obtained from FTD, AD, and healthy aging participants that were matched based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Additionally, a subset of participants also provided paired cerebrospinal fluid samples to compare neuronal SEV miRNAs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Neuronal SEV were isolated using differential ultracentrifugation and antibody conjugated Dynabeads\u00ae for the neuronal surface marker, L1CAM. RNA sequencing was performed. 12 FTD, 11 with AD, and 10 healthy aging participants were enrolled in the study. In FTD, SEV miRNA-181c was downregulated compared to healthy controls. In AD, miRNA-122 and miRNA-3591 were downregulated compared to those in healthy controls and FTD. Using an FDR <0.2, only miRNA-21-5p was found to have increased expression in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to plasma in a group of AD and FTD participants. SEV miRNA-181c is significantly downregulated in FTD compared to healthy controls and may mediate its effects through microglial-directed neuroinflammation and interaction with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) based on pathway analysis. Additionally, the FOXO and Hippo pathways may be important mediators of FTD, based on pathway analysis. Lastly, because only one SEV miRNA was differentially expressed between the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in paired samples, plasma represents an appropriate biofluid for studying neuronal SEV miRNA.",

The implementation of scalable, sustainable, and patient-driven processes may improve early detection of ADRD; however, there are competing approaches; information may be obtained either directly from a patient (e.g., through a questionnaire) or passively using electronic health record (EHR) data. In this study, we aim to identify the benefit of a combined approach using a pragmatic cluster-randomized clinical trial.We have developed a Passive Digital Marker (PDM), based on machine learning algorithms applied to EHR data, and paired it with a patient-reported outcome (the Quick Dementia Rating Scale or QDRS) to rapidly share an identified risk of impairment to a patient's physician. Clinics in both south Florida and Indiana will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms: 1200 patients in each of the two populations will be administered either the PDM, the PDM with the QDRS, or neither, for a total of 7200 patients across all clinics and populations. Both incidence of ADRD diagnosis and acceptance into ADRD diagnostic work-up regimens is hypothesized to increase when patients are administered both the PDM and QDRS. Physicians performing the work-up regimens will be blind to the study arm of the patient.This study aims to test the accuracy and effectiveness of the two scalable approaches (PDM and QDRS) for the early detection of ADRD among older adults attending primary care practices. The data obtained in this study may lead to national early detection and management program for ADRD as an efficient and beneficial method of reducing the current and future burden of ADRD, as well as improving the annual rate of newly documented ADRD in primary care practices.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05231954 .

However, confirmatory studies are required to demonstrate their usefulness in the clinical setting.We evaluated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from consecutive patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (n = 59), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 31), corticobasal syndrome (CBS) (n = 29), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 49), Alzheimer disease (AD) (n = 97), and suspected non-AD physiopathology (n = 51), as well as plasma samples from 60 healthy controls (HC). We measured neurofilament light chain (NfL), phospho-tau181 (p-tau181), and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) using Simoa (all plasma biomarkers and CSF GFAP), CLEIA (CSF p-tau181), and ELISA (CSF NfL) assays. Additionally, we stratified patients according to the A/T/N classification scheme and the CSF \u03b1-synuclein real-time quaking-induced conversion assay (RT-QuIC) results.We found good correlations between CSF and plasma biomarkers for NfL (rho = 0.668, p < 0.001) and p-tau181 (rho = 0.619, p < 0.001). Plasma NfL was significantly higher in disease groups than in HC and showed a greater increase in FTD than in AD [44.9 (28.1-68.6) vs. 21.9 (17.0-27.9) pg/ml, p < 0.001]. Conversely, plasma p-tau181 and GFAP levels were significantly higher in AD than in FTD [3.2 (2.4-4.3) vs. 1.1 (0.7-1.6) pg/ml, p < 0.001; 404.7 (279.7-503.0) vs. 198.2 (143.9-316.8) pg/ml, p < 0.001]. GFAP also allowed discriminating disease groups from HC. In the distinction between FTD and AD, plasma p-tau181 showed better accuracy (AUC 0.964) than NfL (AUC 0.791) and GFAP (AUC 0.818). In DLB and CBS, CSF amyloid positive (A+) subjects had higher plasma p-tau181 and GFAP levels than A- individuals. CSF RT-QuIC showed positive \u03b1-synuclein seeding activity in 96% DLB and 15% AD patients with no differences in plasma biomarker levels in those stratified by RT-QuIC result.In a single-center clinical cohort, we confirm the high diagnostic value of plasma p-tau181 for distinguishing FTD from AD and plasma NfL for discriminating degenerative dementias from HC. Plasma GFAP alone differentiates AD from FTD and neurodegenerative dementias from HC but with lower accuracy than p-tau181 and NfL. In CBS and DLB, plasma p-tau181 and GFAP levels are significantly influenced by beta-amyloid pathology.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation is considered as a main pathological mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rose Bengal (RB) is a synthetic dye used for disease diagnosis, which was reported to inhibit tau toxicity via inhibiting tau aggregation in Drosophila. However, it was unknown if RB could produce anti-AD effects in rodents.The research aimed to investigate if and how RB could prevent \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) oligomers-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in rodents.RB was tested in vitro (0.3-1\u00a0\u03bcM) and prevented A\u03b2 oligomers-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in PC12 cells. Moreover, RB (10-30\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) effectively attenuated cognitive impairments induced by A\u03b2 oligomers in mice. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that RB significantly increased the expression of pSer473-Akt, pSer9-glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and reduced the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) both in vitro and in vivo. Molecular docking analysis suggested that RB might directly interact with GSK3\u03b2 and CDK5 by acting on ATP binding sites. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that RB might act on protein phosphorylation pathways to inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation.RB was shown to inhibit tau neurotoxicity at least partially via inhibiting the activity of GSK3\u03b2 and CDK5, which is a novel neuroprotective mechanism besides the inhibition of tau aggregation. As tau hyperphosphorylation is an important target for AD therapy, this study also provided support for investigating the drug repurposing of RB as an anti-AD drug candidate.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Human genetic and animal model studies indicate that brain microglial inflammation is a primary driver of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer Disease (AD). Inflammasome-activated Caspase-1 (Casp1) is associated with both AD microglial inflammation and neuronal degeneration. In mice, Casp1 genetic ablation or VX-765 small molecule inhibition of Casp1 given at onset of cognitive deficits strongly supports the association between microglial inflammation and cognitive impairment. Here, VX-765 significantly improved episodic and spatial memory impairment eight months after the onset of cognitive impairment in aged AD mice with significant amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b2) accumulation and microglial inflammation. Unexpectedly, while cognitive improvement was associated with dendritic spine density and hippocampal synaptophysin level recovery, VX-765 only slightly decreased A\u03b2 deposition and did not alter biochemically-measured A\u03b2 levels. Furthermore, increased hippocampal Iba1+-microglia, GFAP+-astrocytes, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 levels were unaltered by VX-765. These results support the hypothesis that neuronal degeneration, not A\u03b2 or microglial inflammation, drives cognitive impairment in AD.",

Tai Chi Quan (TCQ) has positive benefits for brain health and chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to summarize the protective effects of TCQ for motor function, cognition, quality of life, and mood in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.A systematic search was conducted via PubMed database and the Web of Science core collection database until August 20, 2021. The available English systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical trials were included. Two reviewers completed the screening and assessment process independently.A total of 28 studies on Parkinson's disease, 21 on cognitive impairment, and 9 on multiple sclerosis met the included criteria. The study found that TCQ remarkably improved general motor function and balance, and prevented falls for Parkinson's disease. TCQ significantly improved global cognitive function for cognitive impairment. TCQ was likely safe and beneficial for multiple sclerosis as result of heterogeneous outcomes and small samples.TCQ exercise can effectively improve the motor function, global cognitive function, and falls in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the positive effects of TCQ on the quality of life and mood of patients with neurodegenerative diseases need further evidence.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "There is uncertainty about the association between alcohol consumption and stroke, particularly for low-moderate intake. We explored these associations in a large international study.INTERSTROKE, a case-control study, is the largest international study of risk factors for acute stroke. Alcohol consumption was self-reported and categorised by drinks/week as low (1-7), moderate (7-14 for females, 7-21 for males) or high (>14 for females, >21 for males). Heavy episodic drinking (HED) was defined as >5 drinks on \u22651 day per month. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to determine associations.We included 12,913 cases and 12,935 controls; 25.0% (n=6,449) were current drinkers, 16.7% (n=4,318) former and 58.3% (n=15,076) never drinkers. Current drinkers were younger, male, smokers, active and with higher-paid occupations. Current drinking was associated with all stroke (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.04-1.26) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21-1.84) but not ischaemic stroke (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.95-1.19). HED pattern was associated with all stroke (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.21-1.59), ischaemic stroke (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.10-1.51) and ICH (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.31-2.36). High level of alcohol intake was consistently associated with all stroke, ischaemic stroke and ICH. Moderate intake was associated with all stroke and ICH, but not ischaemic stroke. Low alcohol intake was not associated with stroke overall but there were regional differences; low intake was associated with reduced odds of stroke in Western Europe/North America (OR 0.66; 95%CI 0.45-0.96) and increased odds in India (OR 2.18; 95%CI 1.42-3.36)(p-interaction 0.037). Wine consumption was associated with reduced odds of all stroke and ischaemic stroke but not ICH. The magnitudes of association were greatest in those without hypertension and current smokers.High and moderate intake were associated with increased odds of stroke, while low intake was not associated with stroke. However, there were important regional variations, which may relate to differences in population characteristics of alcohol consumers, types or patterns of consumption.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The metabolism of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is different in carriers of APOE4, the main genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The brain relies on the plasma DHA pool for its need, but the plasma-liver-brain axis in relation to cognition remains obscure. We hypothesized that this relationship is compromised in APOE4 mice considering the differences in fatty acid metabolism between APOE3 and APOE4 mice. Male and female APOE3 and APOE4 mice were fed either a diet enriched with DHA (0.7 g DHA/100 g diet) or a control diet for 8 months. There was a significant genotype\u202f\u00d7\u202fdiet interaction for DHA concentration in the liver and adipose tissue. In the cortex, a genotype effect was found where APOE4 mice had a higher concentration of DHA than APOE3 mice fed the control diet. There was a significant genotype\u202f\u00d7\u202fdiet interaction for the liver and hippocampal arachidonic acid (AA). APOE4 mice had 20-30% lower plasma DHA and AA concentrations than APOE3 mice, independent of diet. Plasma and liver DHA levels were significantly correlated in APOE3 and APOE4 mice. In APOE4 mice, there was a significant correlation between plasma, adipose tissues, and cortex DHA and the Barnes maze and/or with a better recognition index. Moreover, higher AA levels in the liver and the hippocampus of APOE4 mice were correlated with lower cognitive performance. Our results suggest that there is a plasma-liver-brain axis of DHA that is modified in APOE4 mice. Moreover, our data support that APOE4 mice rely more on plasma DHA than APOE3 mice, especially in cognitive performance. Any disturbance in plasma DHA metabolism might have a greater impact on cognition in APOE4 carriers.",

Previous studies found that moxibustion had good therapeutic effects on AD. We here investigated whether moxibustion could alleviate the cognitive impairment of AD by promoting the \"astrocyte-neuron\" interaction and enhancing synaptic plasticity.Moxibustion treatment was administrated to Baihui (GV20) and Yongquan (KI1) in APP/PS1 mice. We first evaluated the behavior of APP/PS1 mice with Morris water maze test, and observed the synaptic structure before and after moxibustion intervention. Then, the transcriptome characteristics (TC) and \"astrocyte-neuron\" interaction were evaluated by spatial transcriptomics (ST). CD38 and its ligand Pecam1, one of the energy shuttle pathways between neurons and astrocytes, were also be detected.The results supported that moxibustion increased learning and memory ability and synaptic structure. ST showed that the TC were more similar between the moxibustion and control groups. Moxibustion enhanced the number of ligand - receptor pairs between astrocytes and neurons. And the score of interaction intensity and the proportion of interaction were also increased. Meanwhile, the energy of astrocytes and neurons was significantly altered. Additionally, moxibustion could significantly improve the function of CD38 and its ligand Pecam1 which were previously reported having the function of transporting mitochondria from astrocytes to neurons, and then providing energy for neurons.Our study provides new evidences for the use of moxibustion to increase the \"astrocyte - neuron\" interaction thus to enhance synaptic plasticity of APP/PS1 mice.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The fibrillization and deposition of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) protofibrils are one of the important factors leading to Alzheimer's disease. Molecular dynamics simulations can offer information on intermolecular interaction mechanisms between A\u03b2 protofibrils and A\u03b2 fibrillization inhibitors. Here, in this work, we explore the early molecular mechanisms of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and apigenin on disrupting A\u03b242 protofibrils based on molecular simulations. The binding modes of EGCG and apigenin with the A\u03b242 protofibril are obtained. Furthermore, we compare the behavioral mechanisms of EGCG and apigenin on disturbing the A\u03b242 protofibril. Both EGCG and apigenin are able to decrease the proportion of the \u03b2-sheet and bend structures of the A\u03b242 protofibril while inducing random coil structures. The results of hydrogen bonds and D23-K28 salt bridges illustrate that EGCG and apigenin have the ability of destabilizing the A\u03b242 protofibril. Meanwhile, the van der Waals interactions between the EGCG and A\u03b242 protofibril are shown to be larger than that of apigenin with the A\u03b242 protofibril, but the electrostatic interactions between apigenin and the A\u03b242 protofibril are dominant in the binding affinity. Our findings may help in designing effective drug candidates for disordering the A\u03b2 protofibril and impeding A\u03b2 fibrillization.",

However, whether UPF are associated with dementia is unknown. The authors investigated the associations between UPF and dementia incidence in the UK Biobank.We included 72,083 participants (55 years or older) who were free from dementia at baseline and provided at least 2 times 24-hour dietary assessments from the UK Biobank study. Follow-up occurred through March 2021. UPF were defined according to the NOVA classification. Incident all-cause dementia comprising Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia was ascertained through electronic linkages to hospital and mortality records. Cox proportional hazards were used to estimate the association between the proportion (%) of UPF in the diet and the subsequent risk of dementia. In addition, substitution analysis was used to estimate the risk of dementia when substituting UPF with an equivalent proportion of unprocessed or minimally processed foods.During a total of 717,333 person-years of follow-up (median 10.0 years), 518 participants developed dementia, of whom 287 developed AD and 119 developed vascular dementia. In the fully adjusted model, consumption of UPF was associated with higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] for 10% increase in UPF 1.25; 95% CI 1.14-1.37), AD (HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.00-1.30), and vascular dementia (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.55), respectively. In addition, replacing 10% of UPF weight in diet with an equivalent proportion of unprocessed or minimally processed foods was estimated to be associated with a 19% lower risk of dementia (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.74-0.89).In this prospective cohort study, higher consumption of UPF was associated with higher risk of dementia, whereas substituting unprocessed or minimally processed foods for UPF was associated with lower risk of dementia.",

It first seemed like the SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily caused a serious respiratory syndrome. However, over the last years, an increasing number of studies also pointed towards the damaging effects of this infection has on the central nervous system (CNS). In fact, evidence suggests a possible disruption of the blood-brain barrier and deleterious effects on the CNS, especially in patients who already suffer from other pathologies, such as neurodegenerative disorders. The molecular mechanisms behind these effects on the CNS could involve the dysregulation of mitochondrial physiology, a well-known early marker of neurodegeneration and a hallmark of aging. Moreover, mitochondria are involved in the activation of the inflammatory response, which has also been broadly described in the CNS in COVID-19.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene are associated with increased risk for late-onset AD. Genetic loss of or decreased TREM2 function impairs the microglial response to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques, resulting in more diffuse A\u03b2 plaques and increased peri-plaque neuritic dystrophy and AD-tau seeding. Thus, microglia and TREM2 are at a critical intersection of A\u03b2 and tau pathologies in AD. Since genetically decreasing TREM2 function increases A\u03b2-induced tau seeding, we hypothesized that chronically increasing TREM2 signaling would decrease amyloid-induced tau-seeding and spreading. Using a mouse model of amyloidosis in which AD-tau is injected into the brain to induce A\u03b2-dependent tau seeding/spreading, we found that chronic administration of an activating TREM2 antibody increases peri-plaque microglial activation but surprisingly increases peri-plaque NP-tau pathology and neuritic dystrophy, without altering A\u03b2 plaque burden. Our data suggest that sustained microglial activation through TREM2 that does not result in strong amyloid removal may exacerbate A\u03b2-induced tau pathology, which may have important clinical implications.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "This study identified the rate of change in cognitive function of community-based middle-aged and older adults and investigated the longitudinal effects of depression, health status, and health behavior by cognitive function group [normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia] using data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging.This longitudinal panel analysis collected 21,425 data points from 4285 participants. Cognitive function change patterns in the groups were examined through descriptive analysis. A fixed-effects model was estimated using demographic factors, such as depression, health behavior, and disease states as independent variables.Compared with the baseline score of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the 8-year mean score decreased by 10.51, 8.6, and 1.21 for the dementia, MCI, and normal groups, respectively. The estimates for the normal group showed that an increase in the depression score significantly negatively impacted the MMSE score (B=-0.059, P<0.001). However, compared with those of the MCI group (B=-0.044, P>0.05), the estimates of the dementia group confirmed that depression significantly negatively affected cognitive function (B=-0.146, P<0.05).Each group showed different patterns of cognitive decline. An annual follow-up cognitive impairment screening to investigate changes in MMSE score in community-based older individuals can enable early detection of dementia.",

We investigated whether computer-based eye-tracking (ET) analysis of the King-Devick (KD) test differentiates persons with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) from cognitively unimpaired [control (CO)] and persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD).We recruited 68 participants (37 CO, 10 iNPH, and 21 AD) who underwent neurological examination, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological test battery (CERAD-NB), and a Clinical Dementia Rating interview. The KD reading test was performed using computer-based ET. We analyzed the total time used for the reading test, number of errors, durations of fixation and saccade, and saccade amplitudes.The iNPH group significantly differed from the CO group in the KD test mean total time (CO 69.3 s, iNPH 87.3 s; P\u22640.009) and eye-tracking recording of the mean saccade amplitude (CO 3.6 degree, iNPH 3.2 degree; P\u22640.001). The AD group significantly differed from the CO group in each tested parameter. No significant differences were detected between the iNPH and AD groups.For the first time, we demonstrated altered reading ability and saccade amplitudes in patients with iNPH.",

Plasmonic gold nanostars are promising candidates to deliver standard-of-care drugs inside the brain but have not been trialed as carriers for neuroprotectants. Here, we conjugated custom-made peptide dendrimers (termed H3/H6), encompassing motifs of the neurotrophic S100A4-protein, onto star-shaped and spherical gold nanostructures (H3/H6-AuNS/AuNP) and evaluated their potential as neuroprotectants and interaction with neurons. The H3/H6 nanostructures crossed a model blood-brain barrier, bound to plasma membranes, and induced neuritogenesis with the AuNS, showing higher potency/efficacy than the AuNP. The H3-AuNS/NP protected neurons against oxidative stress, the H3-AuNS being more potent, and against Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease (PD/AD)-related cytotoxicity. Unconjugated S100A4 motifs also decreased amyloid beta-induced neurodegeneration, introducing S100A4 as a player in AD. Using custom-made dendrimers coupled to star-shaped nanoparticles is a promising route to activate multiple neuroprotective pathways and increase drug potency to treat neurodegenerative disorders.",

Also, we assessed its efficacy after a follow-up period of 1-year post-intervention.A multicentre, open, quasi experimental study with control group was conducted. 221 caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, with mild to moderate-severe dementia, were non-randomly assigned to either IG-intervention group: psychotherapeutic program without active follow-up period (n = 80); IGF-intervention group: psychotherapeutic program with active follow-up period (n = 78); or CG-control group: support program with active follow-up period (n = 63). The psychotherapeutic intervention (IG and IGF) is a structured cognitive behavioural group program, of one weekly session over four months. The CG had the same duration. Caregiver's burden, mood disorders, resilience, perceived functional social support and quality of life were measured at baseline, post-intervention and after 1-year follow-up.At post-intervention, statistically significant improvements were observed in the IG and IGF compared to CG in caregiver burden (p = 0,0216). After one year follow-up, significant improvements were found in IGF compared to IG in emotional state (p = 0,0271), resilience (p = 0,0018), perceived social support (p = 0,014); quality of life (p = 0,0001) and mental health (p = 0,0002); and in CG versus GI in emotional state and social support (p < 0,05).These results support the efficacy of this psychotherapeutic intervention for improving well-being (burden), and the supportive follow-up period for increasing its efficacy.Efectividad de una intervenci\u00f3n psicoterap\u00e9utica grupal en la mejora del bienestar de personas cuidadoras de un familiar con enfermedad de Alzheimer: estudio CuiDem.Introducci\u00f3n.

There are currently no pharmacologic tools to treat or prevent delirium. Decreased cholinergic signaling plays a role in the pathophysiology of both disorders. Whether enhanced pre-hospital cholinergic signaling in patients with dementia improves outcomes during critical illness remains unknown.We utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database to determine whether pre-hospital donepezil use was associated with improved outcomes during critical illness in dementia patients.We identified 2734 subjects with dementia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; 447 received donepezil). After adjusting for confounders, patients with dementia who were receiving donepezil had a significantly reduced in-hospital and 90-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Donepezil use was associated with, and its benefit was mediated by, reduced delirium.Patients with dementia who are treated with donepezil have improved outcomes during critical illness and reductions in delirium.No pharmacologic treatments exist to reduce delirium in patients with dementia. Donepezil improves outcomes during critical illness in patients with dementia. Improved outcomes are mediated by a reduction in hospital delirium.

In 334 cognitively unimpaired SCD-patients from memory-clinics, we examined the association of DS with cognitive decline and with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers.In the population-based cohort, SCD preceded DS. High DS were associated with increased risk of dementia conversion in individuals with SCD. In SCD-patients from memory-clinics, high DS were associated with greater cognitive decline.

The main objective of this study was to identify the pulmonary radiological patterns in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the factors associated with the need for mechanical ventilation, as well as their survival rates at 30 days.We report the pulmonary tomographic findings of 490 consecutive patients with severe and critical pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2. The patients were classified according to the tomography and demographic findings, sepsis severity prognostic scales, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE IV). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival distributions.89.80% of patients had ground-glass opacities, 81.63% radiologic consolidation sign, 42.45% vascular thickening pattern, 37.55% lymphadenopathies, 14.90% pleural effusion, and 2.65% pulmonary thrombosis; meanwhile, 91.02% had bilateral lesions, 85.51% had peripheral lesions, and 75.92% had basal lobe lesions. APACHE IV (HR, 1.191, 95% CI [1.126, 1.260]), SOFA (HR, 5.178, 95%CI [3.103, 8.641]), and CCI (HR, 0.673, 95%CI [0.510, 0.889]), as well as the pulmonary damage severity index (HR, 1.282, 95%CI [1.151, 1.428]), predict the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Imbalanced synaptic transmission appears to be an early driver in Alzheimer's disease (AD) leading to brain network alterations. Early detection of altered synaptic transmission and insight into mechanisms causing early synaptic alterations would be valuable treatment strategies. This study aimed to investigate how whole-brain networks are influenced at pre- and early-plague stages of AD and if these manifestations are associated with concomitant cellular and synaptic deficits.\u00a0 METHODS: To this end, we used an established AD rat model (TgF344-AD) and employed resting state functional MRI and quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis, a method to detect recurrent spatiotemporal motifs of brain activity, in parallel with state-of-the-art immunohistochemistry in selected brain regions.At the pre-plaque stage, QPPs in TgF344-AD rats showed decreased activity of the basal forebrain (BFB) and the default mode-like network. Histological analyses revealed increased astrocyte abundance restricted to the BFB, in the absence of amyloid plaques, tauopathy, and alterations in a number of cholinergic, gaba-ergic, and glutamatergic synapses. During the early-plaque stage, when mild amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) accumulation was observed in the cortex and hippocampus, QPPs in the TgF344-AD rats normalized suggesting the activation of compensatory mechanisms during this early disease progression period. Interestingly, astrogliosis observed in the BFB at the pre-plaque stage was absent at the early-plaque stage. Moreover, altered excitatory/inhibitory balance was observed in cortical regions belonging to the default mode-like network. In wild-type rats, at both time points, peak activity in the BFB preceded peak activity in other brain regions-indicating its modulatory role during QPPs. However, this pattern was eliminated in TgF344-AD suggesting that alterations in BFB-directed neuromodulation have a pronounced impact in network function in AD.This study demonstrates the value of rsfMRI and advanced network analysis methods to detect early alterations in BFB function in AD, which could aid early diagnosis and intervention in AD. Restoring the global synaptic transmission, possibly by modulating astrogliosis in the BFB, might be a promising therapeutic strategy to restore brain network function and delay the onset of symptoms in AD.",

Carrying the apolipoprotein \u03b54 (APOE4) allele has been associated with an accentuated response to brain inflammation and increases the risk of AD dementia progression. Among inflammation signaling pathways, aberrant eicosanoid activation plays a prominent role in neurodegeneration.Using brains from the Religious Order Study (ROS), this study compared measures of brain eicosanoid lipidome in older persons with AD dementia to age-matched controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI), stratified by APOE genotype.Lipidomic analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex demonstrated lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and DHA-derived neuroprotectin D1 (NPD-1) in persons with AD dementia, all of which associated with lower measures of cognitive function. A significant interaction was observed between carrying the APOE4 allele and higher levels of both pro-inflammatory lipids and pro-resolving eicosanoid lipids on measures of cognitive performance and on neuritic plaque burden. Furthermore, analysis of lipid metabolism pathways implicated activation of calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzymes.These findings implicate activation of the eicosanoid lipidome in the chronic unresolved state of inflammation in AD dementia, which is increased in carriers of the APOE4 allele, and identify potential therapeutic targets for resolving this chronic inflammatory state.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The immune system has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, inflammation, and the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there were few studies on improving the niche microenvironment of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the brain of AD to promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) by regulating the function of non-parenchymal immune cells.The lymph nodes of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) and 3xTg (APP/PS1/tau) mouse models of AD were treated with photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for 10\u00a0J/cm2 per day for 1\u00a0month (10\u00a0min for each day), T lymphocytes isolated from these two AD models were treated with PBMT for 2\u00a0J/cm2 (5\u00a0min for each time). The NSCs isolated from hippocampus of these two AD models at E14, and the cells were co-cultivated with PBMT-treated T lymphocyte conditioned medium for NSCs differentiation.Our results showed that PBMT treatment could promote AHN and reverse cognitive deficits in AD mouse model. The expression of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) was upregulated in the brain of these two AD models after PBMT treated, which was induced by the activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4)/STAT5 signaling pathway in CD4+ T cells. In addition, elevated CD4+ T cell levels and upregulated transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21)/insulin-like growth factors-1 (IGF-1)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein expression levels were also detected in the brain. More importantly, co-cultivated the PBMT-treated T lymphocyte conditioned medium with NSCs derived from these two AD models was shown to promote NSCs differentiation, which was reflected in the upregulation of both neuronal class-III \u03b2-tubulin (Tuj1) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), but the effects of PBMT was blocked by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger or JAK2 inhibitor.Our research suggests that PBMT exerts a beneficial neurogenesis modulatory effect through activating the JAK2/STAT4/STAT5 signaling pathway to promote the expression of IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 in non-parenchymal CD4+ T cells, induction of improvement of brain microenvironmental conditions and alleviation of cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 and 3xTg-AD mouse models.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Chronic heart failure (HF) is known to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia significantly. Thus, detecting and preventing mild cognitive impairment, which is common in patients with HF, is of great importance. Serum biomarkers are increasingly used in neurological disorders for diagnostics, monitoring, and prognostication of disease course. It remains unclear if neuronal biomarkers may help detect cognitive impairment in this high-risk population. Also, the influence of chronic HF and concomitant renal dysfunction on these biomarkers is not well understood.Within the monocentric Cognition.Matters-HF study, we quantified the serum levels of phosphorylated tau protein 181 (pTau) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) of 146 extensively phenotyped chronic heart failure patients (aged 32 to 85 years; 15.1% women) using ultrasensitive bead-based single-molecule immunoassays. The clinical work-up included advanced cognitive testing and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Serum concentrations of NfL ranged from 5.4 to 215.0 pg/ml (median 26.4 pg/ml) and of pTau from 0.51 to 9.22 pg/ml (median 1.57 pg/ml). We detected mild cognitive impairment (i.e., T-score < 40 in at least one cognitive domain) in 60% of heart failure patients. pTau (p = 0.014), but not NfL, was elevated in this group. Both NfL (\u03c1 = -\u20090.21; p = 0.013) and pTau (\u03c1 = -\u20090.25; p = 0.002) related to the cognitive domain visual/verbal memory, as well as white matter hyperintensity volume and cerebral and hippocampal atrophy. In multivariable analysis, both biomarkers were independently influenced by age (T = 4.6 for pTau; T = 5.9 for NfL) and glomerular filtration rate (T = -\u20092.4 for pTau; T = -\u20093.4 for NfL). Markers of chronic heart failure, left atrial volume index (T = 4.6) and NT-proBNP (T = 2.8), were further cardiological determinants of pTau and NfL, respectively. In addition, pTau was also strongly affected by serum creatine kinase levels (T = 6.5) and ferritin (T = -\u20093.1).pTau and NfL serum levels are strongly influenced by age-dependent renal and cardiac dysfunction. These findings point towards the need for longitudinal examinations and consideration of frequent comorbidities when using neuronal serum biomarkers.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) covers a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders with various clinical and neuropathological subtypes. The two major pathological proteins accumulating in the brains of FTD patients, depending on their genetic background, are TDP-43 and tau. We aimed to evaluate whether total TDP-43 levels measured from the serum associate with the genotype or clinical phenotype of the FTD patients and whether serum TDP-43 provides prognostic or diagnostic value in the FTD spectrum disorders.The study cohort included 254 participants with a clinical diagnosis of FTD (including all major genotypes and clinical phenotypes) and 105 cognitively healthy controls. Serum total TDP-43 levels measured with a single-molecule array (Simoa) were compared within the FTD group according to the genotype, clinical phenotype, and predicted neuropathological subtype of the patients. We also evaluated the associations between the TDP-43 levels and disease severity or survival in FTD.Total TDP-43 levels in the serum were significantly lower in the FTD group as compared to the healthy control group (275.3 pg/mL vs. 361.8 pg/mL, B = 0.181, 95%CI = 0.014-0.348, p = 0.034). The lowest TDP-43 levels were observed in the subgroup of FTD patients harboring predicted TDP-43 brain pathology (FTD-TDP, 241.4 pg/mL). The low levels in the FTD-TDP group were especially driven by C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers (169.2 pg/mL) and FTD patients with concomitant motoneuron disease (FTD-MND, 113.3 pg/mL), whereas GRN mutation carriers did not show decreased TDP-43 levels (328.6 pg/mL). Serum TDP-43 levels showed no correlation with disease severity nor progression in FTD.Our results indicate that the total levels of TDP-43 in the serum are decreased especially in FTD patients with the C9orf72 repeat expansion or FTD-MND phenotype, both subtypes strongly associated with TDP-43 type B brain pathology. Serum-based measurement of TDP-43 could represent a useful tool in indicating C9orf72 repeat expansion and FTD-MND-related TDP-43 neuropathology for future diagnostics and intervention studies.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "PPAR\u03b3 agonists have been proven to be neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we identified ligustrazine piperazine derivative (LPD) as a novel PPAR\u03b3 agonist, which was detected by a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. LPD treatment dose-dependently reduced A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels in PC12 cells stably transfected with APP695swe and PSEN1dE9. Intragastric administration of LPD for 3 months dose-dependently reversed cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. LPD treatment substantially decreased hippocampal A\u03b2 plaques in APP/PS1 mice and decreased the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, LPD treatment induced mitophagy in vivo and in vitro and increased brain 18F-FDG uptake in APP/PS1 mice. LPD treatment significantly increased OCR, ATP production, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and basal respiration in APP/PS1 cells. Mechanistically, LPD treatment upregulated PPAR\u03b3, PINK1, and the phosphorylation of Parkin (Ser65) and increased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio but decreased SQSTM1/p62 in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, all these protective effects mediated by LPD were abolished by cotreatment with the selective PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662. In summary, LPD could increase brain glucose metabolism and ameliorate cognitive deficits through PPAR\u03b3-dependent enhancement of mitophagy in APP/PS1 mice.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Brain damage associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs even decades before the symptomatic onset, raising the need to investigate its progression from prodromal stages. In this context, animal models that progressively display AD pathological hallmarks (e.g. TgF344-AD) become crucial. Translational technologies, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), enable the longitudinal metabolic characterization of this disease. However, an integrative approach is required to unravel the complex metabolic changes underlying AD progression, from early to advanced stages. TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) rats were studied in vivo on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner, for longitudinal quantitative assessment of brain metabolic profile changes using MRS. Disease progression was investigated at 4 time points, from 9 to 18\u00a0months of age, and in 4 regions: cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Compared to WT, TgF344-AD rats replicated common findings in AD patients, including decreased N-acetylaspartate in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased glutamate in the thalamus and striatum. Different longitudinal evolution of metabolic concentration was observed between TgF344-AD and WT groups. Namely, age-dependent trajectories differed between groups for creatine in the cortex and thalamus and for taurine in cortex, with significant decreases in Tg344-AD animals; whereas myo-inositol in the thalamus and striatum showed greater increase along time in the WT group. Additional analysis revealed divergent intra- and inter-regional metabolic coupling in each group. Thus, in cortex, strong couplings of N-acetylaspartate and creatine with myo-inositol in WT, but with taurine in TgF344-AD rats were observed; whereas in the hippocampus, myo-inositol, taurine and choline compounds levels were highly correlated in WT but not in TgF344-AD animals. Furthermore, specific cortex-hippocampus-striatum metabolic crosstalks were found for taurine levels in the WT group but for myo-inositol levels in the TgF344-AD rats. With a systems biology perspective of metabolic changes in AD pathology, our results shed light into the complex spatio-temporal metabolic rewiring in this disease, reported here for the first time. Age- and tissue-dependent imbalances between myo-inositol, taurine and other metabolites, such as creatine, unveil their role in disease progression, while pointing to the inadequacy of the latter as an internal reference for quantification.",

The pathophysiological processes triggered by aging that render the brain vulnerable to dementia involve, at least in part, changes in inflammatory mediators. Here we show that lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a lipid mediator of inflammation resolution known to stimulate endocannabinoid signaling in the brain, is reduced in the aging central nervous system. We demonstrate that genetic suppression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), the enzyme mediating LXA4 synthesis, promotes learning impairment in mice. Conversely, administration of exogenous LXA4 attenuated cytokine production and memory loss induced by inflammation in mice. We further show that cerebrospinal fluid LXA4 is reduced in patients with dementia and positively associated with cognitive performance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and AD-linked amyloid-\u03b2. Our findings suggest that reduced LXA4 levels may lead to vulnerability to age-related cognitive disorders and that promoting LXA4 signaling may comprise an effective strategy to prevent early cognitive decline in AD.",

There are several genes have been found to relate to AD, including the human-specific Notch2 N terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. The CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC has been reported in clinically diagnosed AD patients. However, it has not been reported in pathologically confirmed AD cases. In this study, we detected the NOTCH2NLC CGG repeat expansion in pathologically confirmed AD brain samples by repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR (AL-PCR). As a result, the intermediate-length CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was validated in one out of 39 pathologically confirmed AD cases. Pathologically, p62 positive intranuclear inclusions were observed in wide brain areas, and most inclusions appeared to be presented in the glial cells. In summary, our study found that the intermediate-length CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was associated with pathologically confirmed AD. The p62-positive intranuclear inclusions could co-exist with AD neuropathologic changes. These data suggest that the association of NOTCH2NLC CGG repeat expansion with AD may be stronger than in previous studies.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "This study aimed to examine whether baseline CSF measures of Alzheimer disease (AD)-related pathology are associated with the time to onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and whether these associations differ by age, sex, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) status, and proximal (\u22647 years) vs distal (>7 years) time to symptom onset.Measures of amyloid (A\u03b21-42 and A\u03b21-40), phospho-tau (ptau181), and total tau (t-tau) were determined from CSF samples obtained at baseline from participants in an ongoing longitudinal project, known as the Biomarkers for Older Controls at Risk for Alzheimer Disease study (BIOCARD) study. The fully automated, Lumipulse G immunoassay was used to analyze the specimens. Cox regression models were used to examine the relationship of baseline biomarker levels with time to symptom onset of MCI and interactions with age, sex, and ApoE allelic status in subjects who progressed from normal cognition to MCI.Analyses included 273 participants from the BIOCARD cohort, who were cognitively normal and predominantly middle-aged at baseline, and have been followed for an average of 16 years (max = 23.6). During follow-up, 94 progressed to MCI (median time to symptom onset = 6.9 years). In Cox regression models, elevated ptau181 and t-tau levels were associated with time to MCI symptom onset if it occurred within 7 years of baseline (HR 1.386 and 1.329; p = 0.009 and 0.017, respectively), while a lower A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio was associated with symptom onset if it occurred >7 years from baseline (HR 0.596, p = 0.003). There were also significant 3-way CSF \u00d7 age \u00d7 sex interactions for ptau181 and A\u03b242/A\u03b240, with follow-up analyses indicating that associations between these biomarkers and progression to MCI were stronger among men than among women, but this difference between sexes diminished with increasing age.The lengthy follow-up of BIOCARD participants permitted an examination of time-varying associations between CSF AD biomarkers with MCI symptom onset and the influence of sex, baseline age, and ApoE4 genotype on these associations. These factors may inform clinical trial enrollment strategies, or trial duration and outcomes, which may use these measures as surrogate markers of treatment response.",

A\u03b2 clearance in the periphery contributes to reducing brain A\u03b2 levels and preventing Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. We show here that erythropoietin (EPO) increases phagocytic activity, levels of A\u03b2-degrading enzymes, and A\u03b2 clearance in peripheral macrophages via PPAR\u03b3. Erythropoietin is also shown to suppress A\u03b2-induced inflammatory responses. Deletion of EPO receptor in peripheral macrophages leads to increased peripheral and brain A\u03b2 levels and exacerbates Alzheimer's-associated brain pathologies and behavioral deficits in AD-model mice. Moreover, erythropoietin signaling is impaired in peripheral macrophages of old AD-model mice. Exogenous erythropoietin normalizes impaired EPO signaling and dysregulated functions of peripheral macrophages in old AD-model mice, promotes systemic A\u03b2 clearance, and alleviates disease progression.

For the genetic studies, nonlinearity was first evaluated for the association between leukocyte cell counts and AD risk using individual-level data from the UK Biobank (n\u2009=\u2009365\u202f913). Subsequently, a 2-sample mendelian randomization framework was applied using genetic instruments for blood leukocyte counts (n\u2009=\u2009563 085); for AD, the European Alzheimer & Dementia Biobank was used, including 85\u202f934 individuals with AD and 401\u202f577 controls and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, including 21\u202f982 individuals with AD and 41\u202f944 controls.Observational and genetically determined types of blood leukocyte counts.Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for AD of cell count percentile groups in observational studies and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for AD per 1 SD genetically determined cell counts.This cohort study included 101\u202f582 participants (55 891 [55.0%] women) with a median age of 58 years (IQR, 48-67 years); of these, 1588 individuals developed AD. Multivariable-adjusted HRs for participants in the less than 5th vs the 25th to 75th (reference) percentile group were 1.24 (95% CI, 0.99-1.54) for blood monocytes and 1.25 for blood eosinophils (95% CI, 1.05-1.50). For participants in the greater than 95th vs the 25th to 75th percentile group, the HR was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.06-1.61) for blood neutrophils. Genetically, no evidence favored possible nonlinear associations. The ORs for AD per 1-SD decrease in genetically determined blood monocytes were 1.04 (95% CI, 1.00-1.10) in the European Alzheimer & Dementia Biobank consortium and 1.09 (95% CI, 1.01-1.17) in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project consortium. Using mendelian randomization, sensitivity analyses and multivariable analysis showed similar results.The findings of this study suggest that low blood monocyte counts are associated with increased AD risk. These findings highlight a potential role of the innate immune system in AD pathogenesis.",

This study aimed to explore mechanisms of development and progression of AD. Comprehensive analysis of GSE16759 was performed to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and mRNAs (DEmRNAs). The differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) were used for the subsequent analysis, including module genes analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and interaction network analysis. Finally, an AD\u2011associated network consisting of lncRNA\u2011miRNA\u2011mRNA\u2011pathway was constructed. A total of 431 DEmRNAs, 35 DElncRNAs, and 103 DEmiRNAs between the AD group and the normal control group were identified. DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in 13 pathways, such as focal adhesion, endocytosis, and mTOR signaling pathway. Three modules significantly related to AD were finally screened. The AD\u2011associated network was constructed, including 2 lncRNAs (A2M\u2011AS1 and ZNF571\u2011AS1), 1 miRNA (hsa\u2011miR\u2011206), 2 mRNAs (NOTCH3 and JAG1), and 2 pathways (notch signaling pathway and endocrine resistance). A2M\u2011AS1, ZNF571\u2011AS1, hsa\u2011miR\u2011206, NOTCH3 and JAG1 may be involved in the mechanisms of AD through notch signaling pathway and endocrine resistance.",

Mediation analysis showed that ALPS-index acted as a significant mediator between regional standardized uptake value ratios of amyloid and tau images and cognitive dysfunction even after correcting for multiple covariates in AD-related brain regions. These regions are responsible for attention, memory, and executive function, which are vulnerable to sleep deprivation.Glymphatic system activity may act as a significant mediator in AD-related cognitive dysfunction even after adjusting for multiple covariates and gray matter volumes.

Whether diet is associated with dementia remains largely unknown. We tested if low adherence to established dietary guidelines is associated with elevated lipids and lipoproteins and with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's dementia \u2013 a dementia subtype with a high frequency of cardiovascular risk factors.We used the prospective Copenhagen General Population Study including 94 184 individuals with dietary information and free of dementia at baseline. Mean age at study entry was 58 years, and 55% (N = 51 720) were women and 45% (N = 42 464) were men. Adherence to dietary guidelines was grouped into low, intermediate and high adherence based on food frequency questionnaires. Main outcomes were non-Alzheimer's dementia and Alzheimer's disease.Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma triglyceride levels were higher in individuals with intermediate and low adherence to dietary guidelines compared with individuals with high adherence (all p for trends <0.001). Age and sex-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for non-Alzheimer's dementia v. individuals with high adherence were 1.19 (95% confidence interval 0.97\u20131.46) for intermediate adherence, and 1.54 (1.18\u20132.00) for low adherence.

Associations of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and their ratio FEV1/FVC with brain volume, gray matter volume, hippocampal volume, and volume of white matter hyperintensities were investigated using multivariable linear regressions for each study separately and then combined using random-effect meta-analyses.FEV1 and FVC were positively associated with brain volume, gray matter volume, and hippocampal volume, and negatively associated with white matter hyperintensities volume after multiple testing correction, with little heterogeneity present between the studies. For instance, an increase of FVC by one unit was associated with 3.5 ml higher brain volume (95% CI: [2.2, 4.9]). In contrast, results for FEV1/FVC were more heterogeneous across studies, with significant positive associations with brain volume, gray matter volume, and hippocampal volume, but not white matter hyperintensities volume. Associations of brain variables with both FEV1 and FVC were consistently stronger than with FEV1/FVC, specifically with brain volume and white matter hyperintensities volume.In cross-sectional analyses, worse pulmonary function is associated with smaller brain volumes and higher white matter hyperintensities burden.",

The model separates general cognitive ability from components indicative of dementia. We examine the validity of this continuous latent dementia index (LDI). We then identify cut-off points along the LDI distributions in each study and align them across studies to distinguish individuals with and without probable dementia. Finally, we validate the LDI by determining its heritability and estimating genetic and environmental correlations between the LDI and clinically diagnosed dementia where available.Results indicate that coordinated estimation of LDI across 10 studies has validity against clinically diagnosed dementia. The LDI can be fit to heterogeneous sets of memory, other cognitive, and functional ability variables to extract a score reflective of likelihood of dementia that can be interpreted similarly across studies despite diverse study designs and sampling characteristics. Finally, the same genetic sources of variance strongly contribute to both the LDI and clinical diagnosis.This latent dementia indicator approach may serve as a model for other research consortia confronted with similar data integration challenges.",

Neuron, microglia, astrocyte, and endothelia markers were detected on intact EVs by multiplexed ELISA.Overall, concentration of recovered bdEVs was not affected by AD. Proteome differences between AD and control were more pronounced for bdEVs than for brain tissue. Levels of t-tau, p-tau, PRDX1, and PRDX6 were significantly elevated in AD bdEVs compared with controls.

The prevalence of MBI based on the MBI-C-informant scores was 1.5% higher than that based on the MBI-C-self scores according to the suggested cut-off score of 8.5. The affective dysregulation domain score of MBI-C-informant was significantly lower than that of MBI-C-self.MBI-C-informant exhibited both high reliability and validity. Discrepancies between MBI-C-informant and MBI-C-self related to the detection rates and affective dysregulation domain scores were noted. The level of consistency and discrepancy between these two versions provide implications for the use of MBI-C in clinical practice and future research.",

We used the Stress and Coping Inventory to assess the frequency of six coping behaviors (i.e., consulting, planning, positive reappraisal, avoidance, fantasizing, and self-blame). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine odds ratios (ORs) for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI subtypes (single- and multiple-domain MCI), and dementia for coping behaviors.Among the eligible 1,015 participants (72.6 [SD\u200a=\u200a5.5] years old in 2014-2015), the numbers for cognitively normal, single-domain MCI, multiple-domain MCI, and dementia were 650 (64.0%), 116 (11.4%), 213 (21.0%), and 36 (3.5%), respectively. Among the six coping behaviors, avoidant coping was significantly associated with noticeable cognitive decline (multiple-domain MCI and dementia). This association remained significant after adjusting for sex, age, education, diagnosis of current major depressive disorder, past history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, regular alcohol consumption, and smoking (OR\u200a=\u200a2.52, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.23 to 5.15). No significant association with other coping behaviors was found.Avoidant coping in mid- and late life is associated with cognitive decline among older people.",

Here, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in combination with histopathological analysis to better understand the underlying pathomechanisms of HDAC6 in AD. We first developed [18F]PB118 which was demonstrated as a valid HDAC6 radioligand with excellent brain penetration and high specificity to HDAC6. PET studies of [18F]PB118 in 5xFAD mice showed significantly increased radioactivity in the brain compared to WT animals, with more pronounced changes identified in the cortex and hippocampus. The translatability of this radiotracer for AD in a potential human use was supported by additional studies, including similar uptake profiles in non-human primates, an increase of HDAC6 in AD-related human postmortem hippocampal tissues by Western blotting protein analysis, and our ex\u00a0vivo histopathological analysis of HDAC6 in postmortem brain tissues of our animals. Collectively, our findings show that HDAC6 may lead to AD by mechanisms that tend to affect brain regions particularly susceptible to AD through an association with amyloid pathology.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "While Alzheimer's disease (AD) can cause a severe economic burden, the specific pathogenesis involved is yet to be elucidated. To identify feature genes associated with AD, we downloaded data from three GEO databases: GSE122063, GSE15222, and GSE138260. In the filtering, we used AD for search keywords, Homo sapiens for species selection, and established a sample size of > 20 for each data set, and each data set contains Including the normal group and AD group. The datasets GSE15222 and GSE138260 were combined as a training group to build a model, and GSE122063 was used as a test group to verify the model's accuracy. The genes with differential expression found in the combined datasets were used for analysis through Gene Ontology (GO) and The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome Pathways (KEGG). Then, AD-related module genes were identified using the combined dataset through a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Both the differential and AD-related module genes were intersected to obtain AD key genes. These genes were first filtered through LASSO regression and then AD-related feature genes were obtained for subsequent immune-related analysis. A comprehensive analysis of three AD-related datasets in the GEO database revealed 111 common differential AD genes. In the GO analysis, the more prominent terms were cognition and learning or memory. The KEGG analysis showed that these differential genes were enriched not only in In the KEGG analysis, but also in three other pathways: neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cAMP signaling pathway, and Calcium signaling pathway. Three AD-related feature genes (SST, MLIP, HSPB3) were finally identified. The area under the ROC curve of these AD-related feature genes was greater than 0.7 in both the training and the test groups. Finally, an immune-related analysis of these genes was performed. The finding of AD-related feature genes (SST, MLIP, HSPB3) could help predict the onset and progression of the disease. Overall, our study may provide significant guidance for further exploration of potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prediction of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The incidence of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing in recent years. Studies have shown that in addition to some genetic abnormalities, the majority of AD patients has a history of long-term exposure to risk factors. Neuroendocrine related risk factors have been proved to be strongly associated with AD. Long-term hormone disorder can have a direct detrimental effect on the brain by producing an AD-like pathology and result in cognitive decline by impairing neuronal metabolism, plasticity and survival. Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) may regulate the complex process of endocrine disorders, and improve metabolic abnormalities, as well as the resulting neuroinflammation and oxidative damage through a variety of pathways. TCM has unique therapeutic advantages in treating early intervention of AD-related neuroendocrine disorders and preventing cognitive decline. This paper reviewed the relationship between neuroendocrine and AD as well as the related TCM treatment and its mechanism. The advantages of TCM intervention on endocrine disorders and some pending problems was also discussed, and new insights for TCM treatment of dementia in the future was provided.",

Identifying individuals at higher risk of late-life dementia remains a global priority.In prospective study of 958 ambulant community-dwelling older women (\u226570 years), lateral spine images (LSI) captured in 1998 (baseline) from a bone density machine were used to assess abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). AAC was classified into established categories (low, moderate and extensive). Cardiovascular risk factors and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping were evaluated. Incident 14.5-year late-life dementia was identified from linked hospital and mortality records.At baseline women were 75.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 years, 44.7% had low AAC, 36.4% had moderate AAC and 18.9% had extensive AAC. Over 14.5- years, 150 (15.7%) women had a late-life dementia hospitalisation (n\u00a0=\u00a0132) and/or death (n\u00a0=\u00a058). Compared to those with low AAC, women with moderate and extensive AAC were more likely to suffer late-life dementia hospitalisations (9.3%, 15.5%, 18.3%, respectively) and deaths (2.8%, 8.3%, 9.4%, respectively). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and APOE, women with moderate and extensive AAC had twice the relative hazards of late-life dementia (moderate, aHR 2.03 95%CI 1.38-2.97; extensive, aHR 2.10 95%CI 1.33-3.32), compared to women with low AAC.In community-dwelling older women, those with more advanced AAC had higher risk of late-life dementia, independent of cardiovascular risk factors and APOE genotype. Given the widespread use of bone density testing, simultaneously capturing AAC information may be a novel, non-invasive, scalable approach to identify older women at risk of late-life dementia.Kidney Health Australia, Healthway Health Promotion Foundation of Western Australia, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Research Advisory Committee Grant, National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.",

Further, in middle adulthood, people with DS develop clinical symptoms associated with premature aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT with a limited treatment duration in AD.We developed a Markov state-transition model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone among Americans living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD. AD states included MCI due to AD, mild AD, moderate AD, severe AD, and death. A hypothetical DMT was assumed to confer a 30% reduction in progression from MCI and mild AD. The base case annual drug acquisition cost was assumed to be $56,000. Other medical and indirect costs were obtained from published literature or list prices. Utilities for patients and caregivers were obtained from the published literature and varied by AD state and care setting (community care or long-term care). We considered 3 DMT treatment strategies: (1) treatment administered until patients reached severe AD (continuous strategy), (2) treatment administered for a maximum duration of 18 months or when patients reached severe AD (fixed-duration strategy), and (3) 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months because of amyloid plaque clearance and the remaining patients continuing treatment until 18 months or until they reached severe AD (test-and-discontinue strategy). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.From the health care sector perspective, continuous treatment with a hypothetical DMT versus BSC resulted in an ICER of $612,354 per QALY gained. The ICER decreased to $157,288 per QALY gained in the fixed-duration strategy, driven by large reductions in treatment costs. With 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months (test-and-discontinue strategy), the ICER was $125,631 per QALY gained. In sensitivity and scenario analyses, the ICER was the most sensitive to changes in treatment efficacy, treatment cost, and the initial population AD state distribution. From the modified societal perspective, ICERs were 6.3%, 20.4%, and 25.1% lower than those from the health care sector perspective for the continuous, fixed-duration, and test-and-discontinue strategies, respectively.Under a set of assumptions for annual treatment costs and the magnitude and duration of treatment efficacy, DMTs used for a limited duration may deliver value consistent with accepted US cost-effectiveness thresholds.",

DPP6-KO mice are impaired in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and exhibit smaller brain size. Recently, we have described novel structures in hippocampal area CA1 in aging mice, apparently derived from degenerating presynaptic terminals, that are significantly more prevalent in DPP6-KO mice compared to WT mice of the same age and that these structures were observed earlier in development in DPP6-KO mice. These novel structures appear as clusters of large puncta that colocalize NeuN, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A, and also partially label for MAP2, amyloid \u03b2, APP, \u03b1-synuclein, and phosphorylated tau, with synapsin-1 and VGluT1 labeling on their periphery. In this current study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we confirm that both APP and amyloid \u03b2 are prevalent in these structures; and we show with immunofluorescence the presence of similar structures in humans with Alzheimer's disease. Here we also found evidence that aging DPP6-KO mutants show additional changes related to Alzheimer's disease. We used in vivo MRI to show reduced size of the DPP6-KO brain and hippocampus. Aging DPP6-KO hippocampi contained fewer total neurons and greater neuron death and had diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease present including accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 and APP and increase in expression of hyper-phosphorylated tau. The amyloid \u03b2 and phosphorylated tau pathologies were associated with neuroinflammation characterized by increases in microglia and astrocytes. And levels of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines increased in aging DPP6-KO mice. We finally show that aging DPP6-KO mice display circadian dysfunction, a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Together these results indicate that aging DPP6-KO mice show symptoms of enhanced neurodegeneration reminiscent of dementia associated with a novel structure resulting from synapse loss and neuronal death. This study continues our laboratory's work in discerning the function of DPP6 and here provides compelling evidence of a direct role of DPP6 in Alzheimer's disease.",

After behavioral testing to evaluate cognitive function, biochemical and immunohistochemical assays were used to analyze key markers of mitochondrial function and synaptic integrity. Oral STX treatment attenuated A\u03b2-associated mitochondrial toxicity and synaptic toxicity in the brain, as previously documented in cultured neurons. STX also moderately improved spatial memory in 5XFAD mice. In addition, STX reduced markers for reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis surrounding amyloid plaques, and also unexpectedly reduced overall levels of cerebral A\u03b2 in the brain.

Identifying systematic differences between RSNs in patients, i.e. discovering neurofunctional subtypes, may further increase our understanding of disease heterogeneity. Currently, no methodology is available to estimate neurofunctional subtypes and their associated RSNs simultaneously.We present an unsupervised learning method for fMRI data, called Clusterwise Independent Component Analysis (C-ICA). This enables the clustering of patients into neurofunctional subtypes based on differences in shared ICA-derived RSNs. The parameters are estimated simultaneously, which leads to an improved estimation of subtypes and their associated RSNs.In five simulation studies, the C-ICA model is successfully validated using both artificially and realistically simulated data (N\u00a0=\u00a030-40). The successful performance of the C-ICA model is also illustrated on an empirical data set consisting of Alzheimer's disease patients and elderly control subjects (N\u00a0=\u00a0250). C-ICA is able to uncover a meaningful clustering that partially matches (balanced accuracy = .72) the diagnostic labels and identifies differences in RSNs between the Alzheimer and control cluster.Both in the simulation study and the empirical application, C-ICA yields better results compared to competing clustering methods (i.e., a two step clustering procedure based on single subject ICA's and a Group ICA plus dual regression variant thereof) that do not simultaneously estimate a clustering and associated RSNs. Indeed, the overall mean adjusted Rand Index, a measure for cluster recovery, equals 0.65 for C-ICA and ranges from 0.27 to 0.46 for competing methods.The successful performance of C-ICA indicates that it is a promising method to extract neurofunctional subtypes from multi-subject resting state-fMRI data. This method can be applied on fMRI scans of patient groups to study (neurofunctional) subtypes, which may eventually further increase understanding of disease heterogeneity.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases and dementia pose a global health challenge in an aging population, exemplified by the increasing incidence and prevalence of its most common form, Alzheimer's disease. Although several approved treatments exist for Alzheimer's disease, they only afford transient symptomatic improvements and are not considered disease-modifying. The psychoactive properties of Cannabis sativa L. have been recognized for thousands of years and now with burgeoning access to medicinal formulations globally, research has turned to re-evaluate cannabis and its myriad phytochemicals as a potential treatment and adjunctive agent for neurodegenerative diseases.This review evaluated the neuroprotective potential of C. sativa's active constituents for potential therapeutic use in dementia and Alzheimer's disease, based on published studies demonstrating efficacy in experimental preclinical settings associated with neurodegeneration.Relevant information on the neuroprotective potential of the C. sativa's phytoconstituents in preclinical studies (in vitro, in vivo) were included. The collated information on C. sativa's component bioactivity was organized for therapeutic applications against neurodegenerative diseases.The therapeutic use of C. sativa related to Alzheimer's disease relative to known phytocannabinoids and other phytochemical constituents were derived from online databases, including PubMed, Elsevier, The Plant List (TPL, www.theplantlist.org), Science Direct, as well as relevant information on the known pharmacological actions of the listed phytochemicals.Numerous C. sativa -prevalent phytochemicals were evidenced in the body of literature as having efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions exemplified by Alzheimer's disease. Several phytocannabinoids, terpenes and select flavonoids demonstrated neuroprotection through a myriad of cellular and molecular pathways, including cannabinoid receptor-mediated, antioxidant and direct anti-aggregatory actions against the pathological toxic hallmark protein in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid \u03b2.These findings provide strong evidence for a role of cannabis constituents, individually or in combination, as potential neuroprotectants timely to the emergent use of medicinal cannabis as a novel treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. Future randomized and controlled clinical studies are required to substantiate the bioactivities of phytocannabinoids and terpenes and their likely synergies.",

Mixed-effects models with baseline sensory and motor function as determinants and 10-year biomarker change as outcome were used. Participants with hearing impairment and worse motor function (among women) showed faster increases in NfL level over time (0.8% per year; 0.3% per year, respectively). There were no significant associations with TTau or A\u03b2. We found consistent relationships between worse baseline hearing and motor function with a faster increase in neurodegeneration, specifically serum NfL level.

Genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies have identified various genes and genetic variants in lipid metabolism that are associated with Alzheimer's disease.

We focus on the sphingolipid pathway and carry out multi-omics analyses to identify central and peripheral metabolic changes in Alzheimer's patients, correlating them to imaging features.

We validate our hypothesis in amyloidogenic APP/PS1 mice and show prolonged exposure to fingolimod\u00a0alleviated synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment in mice.

We aimed to investigate differences in macular VD in the superficial plexus in a large cohort of individuals cognitively unimpaired (CU), with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (MCI-AD), MCI due to cerebrovascular pathology (MCI-Va), probable Alzheimer\u00b4s disease dementia (ADD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD). Clinical, demographical, ophthalmological and OCT-A data from the Neuro-ophthalmology Research at Fundaci\u00f3 ACE (NORFACE) project were analyzed. Differences of macular VD in four quadrants (superior, nasal, inferior and temporal) among the five diagnostic groups were assessed in a multivariate regression model, adjusted by age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease and stroke. The study cohort comprised 672 participants: 128 CU, 120 MCI-AD, 111 MCI-Va, 257 ADD and 56 VaD. Regression analysis showed a significantly higher VD in the temporal quadrant in MCI-AD compared to CU participants (49.05\u2009\u00b1\u20094.91 vs 47.27\u2009\u00b1\u20094.17, p\u2009=\u20090.02, d\u2009=\u20090.40), and a significantly lower VD in the inferior quadrant in MCI-Va compared to CU participants (48.70\u2009\u00b1\u20096.57 vs 51.27\u2009\u00b1\u20096.39, p\u2009=\u20090.02, d\u2009=\u20090.40). Individuals with heart disease presented significantly lower VD in the inferior quadrant than those without (p\u2009=\u20090.01).

In conclusion, our study showed that the MCI-AD and MCI-Va groups had significant differences in macular VD in opposite directions in the temporal and inferior quadrants, respectively, compared to CU participants, suggesting that macular VD might be able to differentiate two pathogenic pathways (AD- and cerebrovascular-related) in early stages of cognitive decline.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, and memory loss. It has been shown that depletion of estrogens renders women vulnerable to AD with menopause women presenting higher risk for AD development than men. However, women under hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) show lower risk for AD, implying that E2 may be protective. It has been shown that E2 exerts its effects through the estrogen receptor (ER) but also via its biologically active metabolites, 2-hydroxyestradiol (2OH), and 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME). We hypothesized that the neuroprotective effects of E2 are partly attributed to its metabolites.SH-SY5Y neuronal cells were subjected oxidative stress (OS) cell death by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in the presence or absence of E2, 2ME and 2OH. Viability was assessed by trypan blue and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assays, intracellular OS with the Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFDA) assay, and Bax, p53 and PUMA quantified by RT-PCR. Tau hyperphosphorylation was studied by western blot.E2 and its metabolites 2OH and 2ME protect from cell death as assessed by the viability assays. Their effect was partly attributed to their antioxidant properties evidenced by the reduction of intracellular OS. Treatment with 2ME resulted in a reduction of Bax, but not p53 or PUMA in cells challenged with OS. Finally, 2ME was able to inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation as well.E2 protects neuron cells partly through its metabolites. Further studies are needed to fully delineate the mechanism for this protection.",

Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were significantly overestimated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) by mean 33.2 minutes and 7.6%, respectively. Slow wave sleep duration was inaccurately measured except by a headband device with electroencephalography. There was no significant difference in accuracy between participants with and without sleep disorders. Studies were undermined by high risk of bias from closed-access algorithms and classification thresholds, and incomplete reporting of accuracy data. Only one study investigated slow wave activity, and none investigated sleep spindles. Nonetheless, we have identified devices that could be used in future studies of sleep and AD risk and discuss some of the limitations of available research.",

Predicting AD progression will clinically help improve diagnosis and empower sufferers in taking proactive care. However, most existing methods only target individuals with a fixed number of historical visits, and only predict the cognitive scores once at a fixed time horizon in the future, which cannot meet practical requirements. In this study, we consider a flexible yet more challenging scenario in which individuals may suffer from the (arbitrary) modality-missing issue, as well as the number of individuals' historical visits and the length of target score trajectories being not prespecified. To address this problem, a multi-modal sequence learning framework, highlighted by deep latent representation collaborated sequence learning strategy, is proposed to flexibly handle the incomplete variable-length longitudinal multi-modal data. Specifically, the proposed framework first employs a deep multi-modality fusion module that automatically captures complementary information for each individual with incomplete multi-modality data. A comprehensive representation is thus learned and fed into a sequence learning module to model AD progression. In addition, both the multi-modality fusion module and sequence learning module are collaboratively trained to further promote the performance of AD progression prediction.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were performed RESULTS: Thirty-four randomized controlled trials comprising 5549 participants, of which fifteen (51.7%) had a low risk of bias, were included. The meta-analysis showed no differences in the cognitive subscale of the AD: Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) between anti-tau drugs and placebo (mean difference [MD]: -0.77, 95% CI: -1.64 to 0.10; minimal important difference 3.1-3.8 points, moderate certainty evidence). For ADAS-Cog, the results subgroup analysis suggested a statistical effect of tau posttranslational modifications on drug inhibition (MD: -0.80, 95% CI: -1.43 to -0.17), which was not seen with tau aggregation inhibitors or immunotherapy (interaction p\u00a0=\u00a00.24). A total of 11.0%, 5.2%, and 4.8% of drugs inhibiting tau aggregation, immunotherapy, and drugs targeting posttranslational modifications, respectively, had a reduced risk of dropouts due to adverse events (AEs).Current evidence suggests that anti-tau drugs are unlikely to have an important impact on slowing cognitive impairment. Although the subgroup analysis suggested that inhibition of tau posttranslational modifications is statistically effective and generally safer because of reduced dropouts due to AEs, the analysis has limited credibility.

Bifidobacterium is the main producer of SCFAs in the gut flora, but oral administration of Bifidobacterium is ineffective due to strong acids and bile salts in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, regulating the levels of SCFAs in the gut is of great significance for AD treatment.We investigated the feasibility of intranasal delivery of MSNs-Bifidobacterium (MSNs-Bi) to the gut and their effect on behavior and brain pathology in APP/PS1 mice.Mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) were efficiently immobilized on the surface of Bifidobacterium.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that currently lacks available effective therapy. Thus, identifying novel molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of AD is urgently demanded. In this study, we exploited tools and concepts of the emerging research area of Network Medicine to unveil a novel putative disease gene signature associated with AD. We proposed a new pipeline, which combines the strengths of two consolidated algorithms of the Network Medicine: DIseAse MOdule Detection (DIAMOnD), designed to predict new disease-associated genes within the human interactome network; and SWItch Miner (SWIM), designed to predict important (switch) genes within the co-expression network. Our integrated computational analysis allowed us to enlarge the set of the known disease genes associated to AD with additional 14 genes that may be proposed as new potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD phenotype.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal cerebral glucose metabolism is largely present in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The brain utilizes glucose as its main energy source and a decline in its metabolism directly reflects on brain function. Weighing on recent evidence, here we systematically assessed the aberrant glucose metabolism associated with amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau accumulation in AD brain. Interlink between insulin signaling and AD highlighted the involvement of the IRS/PI3K/Akt/AMPK signaling, and GLUTs in the disease progression. While shedding light on the mitochondrial dysfunction in the defective glucose metabolism, we further assessed functional consequences of AGEs (advanced glycation end products) accumulation, polyol activation, and other contributing factors including terminal respiration, ROS (reactive oxygen species), mitochondrial permeability, PINK1/parkin defects, lysosome-mitochondrial crosstalk, and autophagy/mitophagy. Combined with the classic plaque and tangle pathologies, glucose hypometabolism with acquired insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction potentiate these factors to exacerbate AD pathology. To this end, we further reviewed AD and DM (diabetes mellitus) crosstalk in disease progression. Taken together, the present work discusses the emerging role of altered glucose metabolism, contributing impact of insulin signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the defective cerebral glucose utilization in AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. The serum metabolome refers to a set of small-molecules which are an important determinant of cellular health. We obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for serum concentrations of 376 metabolites which were population matched with 2 GWAS studies of AD. For each metabolite we performed 2-sample MR (2SMR) using an inverse variance weighted (IVW) estimate for significance testing. After Bonferroni multiple testing correction one metabolite was causally linked to AD in both GWAS: serum urate. This result was supported by robust 2SMR measures and sensitivity analyses. We applied 2SMR to test for a causal relationship between serum urate and other neurodegenerative diseases: Parkinson disease (PD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In ALS but not PD we identified a nominally significant link between serum urate and disease-risk, although in this case increased serum urate was protective. We conclude that serum urate is a modulator of risk for neurodegeneration. Our work has implications for the design of preventative interventions.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Age, genetics, and chromosomal sex have been identified as critical risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The predominant genetic risk factor for LOAD is the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele (APOE4), and the prevalence of LOAD is higher in females. However, the translational validity of APOE4 mouse models for AD-related cognitive impairment remains to be fully determined. The present study investigated the role of both sex and genotype on learning and memory in aged, humanized APOE knock-in mice. Aged (23.27 mo \u00b1 1.21 mo; 39 male/37 female) APOE3/3, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4 mice performed a novel object recognition (NOR) assay. Task-related metrics were analyzed using two-way sex by genotype ANOVAs. Sex differences were more prominent relative to APOE genotype. Prior to NOR, female mice exhibited thigmotaxic center zone avoidance during the open field task relative to males, regardless of genotype. Within object familiarization and NOR tasks, females had greater object interaction and locomotion. Interestingly, only APOE4/4 females on average recognized the novel object. These results suggest that APOE4, although strongly related to LOAD pathogenesis, does not drive cognitive decline in the absence of other risk factors even in very aged mice. Chromosomal sex is a key driver of behavioral phenotypes and thus is a critical variable for translatability of interventions designed to preserve learning and memory in animal models of LOAD. Last, there was a very high degree of variability in behavioral performance across APOE genotypes. A cluster analysis of the behavioral data revealed a low-activity and a high-activity cluster. APOE4 carriers were overrepresented in the low-activity cluster, while male:female distributions did not differ. Collectively, the behavioral data indicate that chromosomal sex has the greatest impact on behavioral phenotype, and APOE4 carrier status may confer greater risk for cognitive decline in some animals.",

This study aimed to examine the relationship between finger movements and brain volume in AD patients using a voxel-based reginal analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) software.Patients diagnosed with AD at the Center for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders were included. The diagnostic criteria were based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association. A finger-tapping device was used for all measurements. Participants performed the tasks in the following order: with their non-dominant hand, dominant hand, both hands simultaneously, and alternate hands. Movements were measured for 15 s each. The relationship between distance and output was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging measurements were performed, and VSRAD was conducted using sagittal section 3D T1-weighted images. The Z-score was used to calculate the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient analyzed the relationship between the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy and mean values of the parameters in the finger-tapping movements. The statistical significance level was set at <5%. The calculated p-values were corrected using the Bonferroni method.Sixty-two patients were included in the study. Comparison between VSRAD and MoCA-J scores corrected for p-values showed a significant negative correlation with the extent of gray matter atrophy (r = -0. 52; p< 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy and standard deviation (SD) of the distance rate of velocity peak in extending movements in the non-dominant hand (r = 0. 51; p< 0.001).The SD of distance rate of velocity peak in extending movements extracted from finger taps may be a useful parameter for the early detection of AD and diagnosis of its severity.",

Risk factors include old age, hypertension and variants in the genes COL4A1/COL4A2 encoding collagen alpha-1(IV) and alpha-2(IV), here termed collagen-IV, which are core components of the basement membrane. We tested the hypothesis that increased vascular collagen-IV associates with clinical hypertension and with SVD in older persons and with chronic hypertension in young and aged primates and genetically hypertensive rats.We quantified vascular collagen-IV immunolabeling in small arteries in a cohort of older persons with minimal Alzheimer's pathology (N=52; 21F/31M, age 82.8\u00b16.95 years). We also studied archive tissue from young (age range 6.2-8.3 years) and older (17.0-22.7 years) primates (M mulatta) and compared chronically hypertensive animals (18 months aortic stenosis) with normotensives. We also compared genetically hypertensive and normotensive rats (aged 10-12 months).Collagen-IV immunolabeling in cerebral small arteries of older persons was negatively associated with radiological SVD severity (\u03c1: -0.427, P=0.005) but was not related to history of hypertension. General linear models confirmed the negative association of lower collagen-IV with radiological SVD (P<0.017), including age as a covariate and either clinical hypertension (P<0.030) or neuropathological SVD diagnosis (P<0.022) as fixed factors. Reduced vascular collagen-IV was accompanied by accumulation of fibrillar collagens (types I and III) as indicated by immunogold electron microscopy. In young and aged primates, brain collagen-IV was elevated in older normotensive relative to young normotensive animals (P=0.029) but was not associated with hypertension. Genetically hypertensive rats did not differ from normotensive rats in terms of arterial collagen-IV.Our cross-species data provide novel insight into sporadic SVD pathogenesis, supporting insufficient (rather than excessive) arterial collagen-IV in SVD, accompanied by matrix remodeling with elevated fibrillar collagen deposition. They also indicate that hypertension, a major risk factor for SVD, does not act by causing accumulation of brain vascular collagen-IV.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Depressive symptoms are associated with age-related cognitive impairment, but the relative risk of specific subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conferred by depressive symptoms is unclear. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the longitudinal association between baseline depressive symptoms and incident cases of MCI subtypes (amnestic vs. non-amnestic) and probable dementia (PD) (Alzheimer's disease, vascular, mixed) among postmenopausal women.Depressive symptoms were assessed at study baseline using an 8-item Burnam algorithm in 7043 postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and the WHIMS-Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS-ECHO) extension study. During the median 9.4-year follow-up interval, the presence of MCI and PD was classified by a central adjudication committee. Classification of participants by MCI subtype (amnestic single and multi-domain, non-amnestic single and multi-domain) was done algorithmically based on established criteria using data from annual cognitive testing.At baseline, 557 women (7.9%) had clinically significant depressive symptoms based on Burnam algorithm cut-point of 0.06. Depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with an increased risk of incident amnestic MCI (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a01.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-2.78, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but not non-amnestic MCI (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI 0.91-2.14, p\u00a0=\u00a00.13) after controlling for demographic factors. This relationship between depressive symptoms and amnestic MCI remained consistent after controlling for lifestyle variables, cardiovascular risk factors, antidepressant use, and history of hormone therapy. There were no significant associations between depressive symptoms and incidence of\u00a0PD.Depressive symptoms at baseline among postmenopausal older women are associated with higher incidence of amnestic MCI, suggesting that they may be an independent risk factor or part of the early prodrome of dementia.",

Statistical analysis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the risk of cognitive impairment or dementia based on data extracted from each article was performed using Stata software v. 16.0. The quality of this study was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of cohort and case-control studies and the American Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) methodology checklist for assessing the quality of cross-sectional studies. Funnel plots and the Egger's test were used to assess publication bias.We included 7 studies comprising 891,562 individuals from 6 countries, which were published between 2020 and 2022. The pooling analysis showed that a history of NAFLD was associated with cognitive impairment [odds ratio (OR) = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.17-1.78; heterogeneity (I 2) = 0%; P = 0.001]. A history of NAFLD was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.97-1.09; I 2 = 84.7%; P = 0.341) or Alzheimer disease (OR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.83-1.09; I 2 = 61.0%; P = 0.489).

To overcome these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian functional GWAS method to account for multivariate quantitative functional annotations (BFGWAS_QUANT), accompanied by a scalable computation algorithm enabling joint modeling of genome-wide variants. Simulation studies validated the performance of BFGWAS_QUANT for accurately quantifying annotation enrichment and improving GWAS power. Applying BFGWAS_QUANT to study five Alzheimer disease (AD)-related phenotypes using individual-level GWAS data (n\u00a0= \u223c1,000), we found that histone modification annotations have higher enrichment than expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) annotations for all considered phenotypes, with the highest enrichment in H3K27me3 (polycomb regression). We also found that cis-eQTLs in microglia had higher enrichment than eQTLs of bulk brain frontal cortex tissue for all considered phenotypes. A similar enrichment pattern was also identified using the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) summary-level GWAS data of AD (n\u00a0= \u223c54,000). The strongest known APOE E4 risk allele was identified for all five phenotypes, and the APOE locus was validated using the IGAP data. BFGWAS_QUANT fine-mapped 32 significant variants from 1,073 genome-wide significant variants in the IGAP data. We also demonstrated that the polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using effect size estimates by BFGWAS_QUANT had a similar prediction accuracy as other methods assuming a sparse causal model. Overall, BFGWAS_QUANT is a useful GWAS tool for quantifying annotation enrichment and prioritizing potential causal variants.",

Given that AD is thought to have a long pre-clinical incubation period, the aim of the current research was to determine whether former NFL players show evidence of incipient dementia in their structural imaging before diagnosis of AD. To identify neuroimaging markers of AD, against which former NFL players would be compared, we conducted a whole-brain volumetric analysis using a cohort of AD patients (ADNI clinical database) to produce a set of brain regions demonstrating sensitivity to early AD pathology (i.e., the \"AD fingerprint\"). A group of 46 former NFL players' brain magnetic resonance images were then interrogated using the AD fingerprint, that is, the former NFL subjects were compared volumetrically to AD patients using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence. The FreeSurfer image analysis suite (version 6.0) was used to obtain volumetric and cortical thickness data. The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric-Version 4 was used to assess current cognitive functioning. A total of 55 brain regions demonstrated significant atrophy or ex vacuo dilatation bilaterally in AD patients versus controls. Of the 46 former NFL players, 41% demonstrated a greater than expected number of atrophied/dilated AD regions compared with age-matched controls, presumably reflecting AD pathology.",

It outperformed prevalent methods of risk assessment for encounters of patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) (4993), vascular dementia (VD) (4173), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) (3735), and other unspecified dementias (OUD) (2777). Top identified hospitalization outcome risk factors, mostly from medical history, include encephalopathy, number of medical problems at admission, pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections, falls, admission source, age, race, anemia, etc., with several overlaps in multi-dementia groups.Our model identified several predictive factors that can be modified or intervened so that efforts can be made to prevent recurrence or mitigate their adverse effects. Knowledge of the modifiable risk factors would help guide early interventions for patients at high risk for poor hospitalization outcome as defined by hospital stays longer than seven days, undesirable discharge disposition, or both.

This article reviews the diversity, constructs, strengths, and limitations of existing environmental assessment tools and identifies gaps for future tool development.A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Avery Index) and terms related to health-care environments and assessment tools.A total of 13 environmental assessment tools for people living with dementia within shared residential settings were identified. Evaluation of the environmental assessment tools includes a synthesis of published data for each tool's reliability, validity, ease of use, interpretability, strengths and weaknesses, as well as a comparison of various tool characteristics including date of development, country of origin, applicable care setting(s), number and variety of measures and underlying constructs, format, and descriptive versus evaluative content.While the shift to person-centered values encompasses all aspects of care and care settings, the majority of person-centered definitions exclude the important role of the designed, physical environment. However, this review of environmental assessment tools clearly demonstrates that newer tools are embracing the full array of PCC values. In the United States, this is shown in the shift from tools designed to assess segregated dementia care settings to tools that integrate the needs and preferences both of individuals living with and without dementia. Next-generation tools need to specifically address the household model of design.The overarching goal of research on physical settings for individuals living with dementia is to identify associations between designed features within the built environment and outcomes of interest.A systematic literature search identified a total of 13 environmental assessment tools for people living with dementia within shared residential settings; these tools were then described and evaluated based on reliability, validity, ease of use, interpretability, strengths, and weaknesses.This review of environmental assessment tools clearly demonstrates that newer tools are embracing the full array of person-centered care values.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous pathological disease with genetic background accompanied by aging. This inconsistency is present among molecular subtypes, which has led to diagnostic ambiguity and failure in drug development. We precisely distinguished patients of AD at the transcriptome level.We collected 1,240 AD brain tissue samples collected from the GEO dataset. Consensus clustering was used to identify molecular subtypes, and the clinical characteristics were focused on. To reveal transcriptome differences among subgroups, we certificated specific upregulated genes and annotated the biological function. According to RANK METRIC SCORE in GSEA, TOP10 was defined as the hub gene. In addition, the systematic correlation between the hub gene and \"A/T/N\" was analyzed. Finally, we used external data sets to verify the diagnostic value of hub genes.We identified three molecular subtypes of AD from 743 AD samples, among which subtypes I and III had high-risk factors, and subtype II had protective factors. All three subgroups had higher neuritis plaque density, and subgroups I and III had higher clinical dementia scores and neurofibrillary tangles than subgroup II. Our results confirmed a positive association between neurofibrillary tangles and dementia, but not neuritis plaques. Subgroup I genes clustered in viral infection, hypoxia injury, and angiogenesis. Subgroup II showed heterogeneity in synaptic pathology, and we found several essential beneficial synaptic proteins. Due to presenilin one amplification, Subgroup III was a risk subgroup suspected of familial AD, involving abnormal neurogenic signals, glial cell differentiation, and proliferation. Among the three subgroups, the highest combined diagnostic value of the hub genes were 0.95, 0.92, and 0.83, respectively, indicating that the hub genes had sound typing and diagnostic ability.The transcriptome classification of AD cases played out the pathological heterogeneity of different subgroups. It throws daylight on the personalized diagnosis and treatment of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Primary progressive aphasia (PPA), typically resulting from a neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of specific language functions while other cognitive domains are relatively unaffected. The logopenic variant, characterized by impairments of word retrieval and sentence repetition along with preserved semantic, syntactic, and motor speech abilities, is the most recently described and remains less understood than other variants due to a comparatively small number of case studies and a lack of investigations with a thorough specification. In this article, we report a 2-year follow-up case study of a 74-year-old Chinese female patient with a logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, including its neurolinguistic study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B-Positron emission tomography imaging analyses, as well as gene sequencing. This case confirms that, in addition to word-finding and sentence repetition difficulties, the logopenic variant may also present with mild auditory comprehension and naming deficits attributed to impaired access to lexical representations. The observation of clinical treatment suggests the efficacy of memantine hydrochloride tablet and rivastigmine transdermal patch in slowing down the cognitive deterioration of this patient. The description and exploration of this case may shed new insights into a better understanding of the Chinese logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia.",

The Alzheimer's and osteoporosis microarray gene expression data were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus, and differentially expressed genes in the blood microenvironment related to Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis were identified. The intersection of the three datasets (GSE97760, GSE168813, and GSE62402) was used to obtain 21 co-expressed targets in the peripheral blood samples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. Based on the degree algorithm, the top 10 potential core target genes related to these diseases were identified, which included CLEC4D, PROK2, SIGLEC7, PDGFB, PTCRA, ECH1, etc. Two differentially expressed mRNAs, Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) and three colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3), were screened in the GSE62402 dataset associated with osteoporosis. Protein-protein rigid docking with ZDOCK revealed that PROK2 and CSF3 could form a stable protein docking model. The interaction of PROK2 and CSF3, core genes related to osteoporosis inflammation, plays an important role in the mechanism of osteoporosis in patients with Alzheimer's. Therefore, abnormalities or alterations in the inflammatory pathways in the peripheral blood samples of Alzheimer's patients may affect the course of osteoporosis.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The mainstay of therapy for many neurodegenerative dementias still relies on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI); however, there is debate on various aspects of such treatment. A huge body of literature exists on possible predictors of response, but a comprehensive review is lacking. Therefore, our aim is to perform a systematic review of the predictors of response to AChEI in neurodegenerative dementias, providing a categorization and interpretation of the results.We conducted a systematic review of the literature up to December 31st, 2021, searching five different databases and registers, including studies on rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine, with clearly defined criteria for the diagnosis of dementia and the response to AChEI therapy. Records were identified through the string: predict * AND respon * AND (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors OR donepezil OR rivastigmine OR galantamine). The results were presented narratively.We identified 1,994 records in five different databases; after exclusion of duplicates, title and abstract screening, and full-text retrieval, 122 studies were finally included.The studies show high heterogeneity in duration, response definition, drug dosage, and diagnostic criteria. Response to AChEI seems associated with correlates of cholinergic deficit (hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, substantia innominate atrophy) and preserved cholinergic neurons (faster alpha on REM sleep EEG, increased anterior frontal and parietal lobe perfusion after donepezil); white matter hyperintensities in the cholinergic pathways have shown inconsistent results. The K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase may correlate with better response in late stages of disease, while the role of polymorphisms in other genes involved in the cholinergic system is controversial. Factors related to drug availability may influence response; in particular, low serum albumin (for donepezil), CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced enzymatic activity and higher drug doses are the most consistent predictors, while AChEI concentration influence on clinical outcomes is debatable. Other predictors of response include faster disease progression, lower serum cholesterol, preserved medial temporal lobes, apathy, absence of concomitant diseases, and absence of antipsychotics. Short-term response may predict subsequent cognitive response, while higher education might correlate with short-term good response (months), and long-term poor response (years). Age, gender, baseline cognitive and functional levels, and APOE relationship with treatment outcome is controversial.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Brain connectivity is useful for deciphering complex brain dynamics controlling interregional communication. Identifying specific brain phenomena based on brain connectivity and quantifying their levels can help explain or diagnose neurodegenerative disorders.This study aimed to establish a unified framework to identify brain connectivity-based biomarkers associated with disease progression and summarize them into a single numerical value, with consideration for connectivity-specific structural attributes.This study established a framework that unifies the processes of identifying a brain connectivity-based biomarker and mapping its abnormality level into a single numerical value, called a biomarker abnormality summarized from the identified connectivity (BASIC) score. A connectivity-based biomarker was extracted in the form of a connected component associated with disease progression. BASIC scores were constructed to maximize Kendall's rank correlation with the disease, considering the spatial autocorrelation between adjacent edges. Using functional connectivity networks, we validated the BASIC scores in various scenarios.Our proposed framework was successfully applied to construct connectivity-based biomarker scores associated with disease progression, characterized by two, three, and five stages of Alzheimer's disease, and reflected the continuity of brain alterations as the diseases advanced. The BASIC scores were not only sensitive to disease progression, but also specific to the trajectory of a particular disease. Moreover, this framework can be utilized when disease stages are measured on continuous scales, resulting in a notable prediction performance when applied to the prediction of the disease.Our unified framework provides a method to identify brain connectivity-based biomarkers and continuity-reflecting BASIC scores that are sensitive and specific to disease progression.",

To date, most intervention studies have only focused on a single AD-related factor and have yielded modest cognitive improvements. Here, we show that environmental enrichment (EE) training combined with Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025 intervention significantly alleviated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced cognitive impairment and inhibited neuroinflammation in mice. Moreover, we found that EE combined with B. breve CCFM1025 treatment restored AD-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and reversed microbial metabolites changes. By integrating behavioral and neurological data with metabolomic profiles, we corroborated the microbiota-metabolite-brain interactions, with acetate and tryptophan metabolism as potential drivers. Taken together, our results provide a promising multidomain intervention strategy to prevent cognitive decline and delay the progression of AD through a combination of dietary microbiome-based approaches and lifestyle interventions.",

There is epidemiological evidence that heart failure (HF) patients are at higher risk of developing AD, and the impact of sacubitril/valsartan, the first angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) approved for HF, on cognitive functions is still controversial. To investigate the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on cognitive functions in colchicine-induced AD rat model. Forty adult male Wistar rats were equally allocated into four groups (each of 10 rats): Group I: normal control, Group II: intracerebroventricular injection of colchicine (15\u2009\u03bcg/5\u00a0\u03bcl/bilaterally), Group III: colchicine (15\u2009\u03bcg/5\u00a0\u03bcl/bilaterally, icv)\u2009+\u2009oral sacubitril/valsartan (100\u2009mg/kg/day) for 25\u2009days, and Group IV: colchicine (15\u2009\u03bcg/5\u00a0\u03bcl/bilaterally, icv)\u2009+\u2009oral valsartan (50\u2009mg/kg/day) for 25\u2009days.

Biochemically, \u03b2-amyloid (1-40 and 1-42) peptides, oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase) and inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) parameters were measured in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Sacubitril/valsartan exaggerated colchicine-induced cognitive impairment in both Morris water maze and passive avoidance tasks and was associated with significant increase in \u03b2-amyloid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation versus valsartan. Sacubitril/valsartan caused deleterious effect on cognitive impairment and biochemical alterations in colchicine-induced AD rat model.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Anticholinergic medications are drugs that block cholinergic transmission, either as their primary therapeutic action or as a secondary effect. Patients with dementia may be particularly sensitive to the central effects of anticholinergic drugs. Anticholinergics also antagonise the effects of the main dementia treatment, cholinesterase inhibitors. Our study aimed to investigate anticholinergic prescribing for dementia patients in UK acute hospitals before and after admission.We included 352 patients with dementia from 17 UK hospital sites in 2019. They were all inpatients on surgical, medical or Care of the Elderly wards. Information about each patient's medications were collected using a standardised form, and the anticholinergic drug burden of each patient was calculated with an evidence-based online calculator. Wilcoxon's rank test was used to look at the correlation between two subgroups upon admission and discharge.On admission to hospital, 37.8% of patients had an anticholinergic burden score\u2009\u2265\u20091 and 5.68% \u22653. On discharge, 43.2% of patients with an anticholinergic burden score\u2009\u2265\u20091 and 9.1% \u22653. The increase in scores was statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u20090.001). Psychotropics were the most common group of anticholinergic medications prescribed at discharge. Of those patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors, 44.9% were also prescribed anticholinergic medications.Our cross-sectional, multicentre study found that people with dementia are commonly prescribed anticholinergic medications, even if concurrently taking cholinesterase inhibitors, and are significantly more likely to be discharged from hospital with a higher anticholinergic burden than on admission.",

Given that dementia-related psychosis comprises various dementia types, this study describes the incidence of clinical events and treatment patterns by dementia type after patients with dementia are diagnosed with psychosis.Adults aged\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years with dementia and newly diagnosed with psychosis were identified in US Medicare claims during 2013-2018. Baseline characteristics were evaluated at the time of the psychosis diagnosis. After the initial psychosis diagnosis, incidence rates (IRs) of clinical events (e.g., falls/fractures, infections, healthcare utilization), mortality, and patterns of antipsychotic treatment were described for each dementia type (Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease dementia [PDD], dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], frontotemporal dementia [FTD], vascular dementia [VD], and unspecified dementia). Daily mean cumulative counts were estimated to describe the incidence of recurrent events over time. Mortality was described using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.We identified 484,520 patients with dementia-related psychosis: mean age, 84\u00a0years (standard deviation, 7.8); female, 66%. At the time of psychosis diagnosis, the most prevalent type of dementia was unspecified dementia (56%), followed by AD (31%), VD (12%), PDD (10%), DLB (3%), and FTD (<\u20091%), and most patients had scores indicating severe illness on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (71%) and frailty index (62%).

Patients with DLB had the highest incidence of most clinical outcomes. After 1\u00a0year of follow-up, the cumulative probability of death was about 30% for all dementia types, and after 5\u00a0years, was about 80% among patients with DLB, VD, AD, or PDD and about 60%-65% among patients with FTD or unspecified dementia.Patients with dementia-related psychosis had a high burden of comorbidities, frailty, emergency department visits, infections, and death.

Here, we demonstrate that hexokinase 2 (HK2) is elevated in microglia from an AD mouse model (5xFAD) and AD patients. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of HK2 significantly promotes microglial phagocytosis, lowers the amyloid plaque burden and attenuates cognitive impairment in male AD mice. Notably, the ATP level is dramatically increased in HK2-deficient or inactive microglia, which can be attributed to a marked upregulation in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression and subsequent increase in lipid metabolism. We further show that two downstream metabolites of HK2, glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate, can reverse HK2-deficiency-induced upregulation of LPL, thus supporting ATP production and microglial phagocytosis. Our findings uncover a crucial role for HK2 in phagocytosis through regulation of microglial energy metabolism, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for AD by targeting HK2.",

Regional volumetric and cortical thickness measures were quantified in both the cerebellum and the cerebrum using the cerebellum segmentation algorithm and Freesurfer5.3, respectively.Our corrected functional connectivity (FC) results showed that APOE4 carriers (APOE4+) had lower FC within the cerebro-cerebellar motor network. In addition, significant group differences in regional cortical thickness were observed in the left Crus I, the right VIIB, left superior frontal, and right middle temporal gyri. Group differences in regional brain volumes were observed in the left lobule V and right parstriangularis. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analysis indicated that APOE4+ AD patients show greater episodic memory impairment.Since amyloid-\u03b2, age, education, and gender were included as confounds in the statistical models, our findings suggest that APOE4 independently contributes to brain atrophy, disrupted FC, and associated memory declines in AD patients.",

A biomarker of neuronal injury, neurofilament light chain (NfL), could reduce misdiagnosis and delay.Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NfL, amyloid beta 1-42 (AB42), total and phosphorylated tau (T-tau, P-tau) levels were examined in patients with an initial diagnosis of bvFTD. Based on follow-up information, patients were categorised as Progressors or Non-Progressors: further subtyped into Non-Progressor Revised (non-neurological/neurodegenerative final diagnosis), and Non-Progressor Static (static deficits, not fully explained by non-neurological/neurodegenerative causes).Forty-three patients were included: 20 Progressors, 23 Non-Progressors (15 Non-Progressor Revised, 8 Non-Progressor Static), and 20 controls. NfL concentrations were lower in Non-Progressors (Non-Progressors Mean, M\u00a0=\u00a0554\u00a0pg/mL, 95%CI:[461, 675], Non-Progressor Revised M\u00a0=\u00a0459\u00a0pg/mL, 95%CI:[385, 539], and Non-Progressor Static M\u00a0=\u00a0730\u00a0pg/mL, 95%CI:[516, 940]), compared to Progressors (M\u00a0=\u00a02397\u00a0pg/mL, 95%CI:[1607, 3332]). NfL distinguished Progressors from Non-Progressors with the highest accuracy (area under the curve 0.92, 90%/87% sensitivity/specificity, 86%/91% positive/negative predictive value, 88% accuracy). Non-Progressor Static tended to have higher T-tau and P-tau levels compared to Non-Progressor Revised Diagnoses.This study demonstrated strong diagnostic utility of CSF NfL to distinguish bvFTD from non-progressor variants, at baseline, with high accuracy, in a real-world clinical setting. This has important clinical implications, to improve outcomes for patients and clinicians facing this challenging clinical dilemma, healthcare services, and clinical trials. Further research is required to investigate heterogeneity within the non-progressor group and potential diagnostic algorithms, and prospective studies are underway assessing plasma NfL.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "This study aimed to analyse the existing evidence on the association between particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and dementia, including two of its subtypes, namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD).This was a systematic review and meta-analysis.The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science databases were comprehensively searched for articles published between January 1900 and June 2022. All cohort studies that reported the influence of long-term exposure to PM2.5 on dementia, together with its subtypes, in adults aged \u226540 years, without any regional restriction were included. A random effects model was used to pool the hazard ratios (HRs) of PM2.5 for dementia, AD and VaD. Funnel plots, sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed to test publication bias and result stability. In addition, an explanation for the heterogeneity of the results was suggested.In total, 20 articles were selected for review; 18 included results on the long-term effects of PM2.5 on dementia, 13 on AD, and eight on VaD. Three group meta-analyses were performed to obtain the HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The pooled HRs were 1.40 (95% CI 1.23, 1.60) for dementia, 1.47 (95% CI 1.22, 1.78) for AD and 2.00 (95% CI 1.30, 3.08) for VaD per 10.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 PM2.5 increase.Long-term exposure to PM2.5 may increase the risk of dementia, including AD and VaD. These results highlight the need for further study on the detrimental impact of PM2.5 and the importance of strategies to mitigate increasing air pollution.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer disease dementia may be preceded by cognitive stages during which behavioral and psychological changes can occur. More precisely, behavioral symptoms may be observed during the subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages; these symptoms can be measured using the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C).To validate the French-Quebec version of the MBI-C in individuals ages 60-85 years.The sample included 60 participants (20 MCI, 20 SCD, 20 cognitively healthy) and their informants. To assess the discriminant validity of the MBI-C, a Kruskal-Wallis analysis with a multiple comparisons test was performed on the MBI-C Total score. To determine convergent validity, Spearman correlations were calculated between the MBI-C subscales and a set of validation tools. Finally, test-retest reliability was assessed with Spearman correlations of MBI-C scores between two test sessions.All of the analyses indicated satisfactory psychometric properties for the French-Quebec version of the MBI-C.This validation study reveals that the MBI-C can be used successfully in dementia risk assessments. From now on, the use of a validated MBI-C will be possible in the French-Quebec population.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Glaucoma disease is characterized by an increased intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucomatous alterations of the optic disc and corresponding visual field defects. Even lowering the main risk factor IOP until an individual target level does not prevent this neurodegenerative disorder from proceeding. Several autoimmune mechanisms were discovered, partly showing a functionality. One of these autoimmune phenomena targets the \u00df2-adrenergic receptor (\u00df2-AR; i.e. agonistic autoantibodies; \u00df2-agAAb) and is linked to an elevated IOP and an impaired retinal microcirculation. As neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is postulated to share a common molecular mechanism with glaucoma. In the present study we investigated autoimmune phenomena targeting the \u00df2-AR in patients with AD. Sera of the patients were analyzed in a rat cardiomyocyte bioassay for the presence of functional autoantibodies against \u00df2-AR. In addition, different species of amyloid beta (A\u00df) monomers were tested (A\u00df1-14, A\u00df10-25, A\u03b210-37 A\u00df1-40, A\u00df1-42, A\u03b228-40, and A\u00df-[Pyr]3-43). Our results demonstrate that none of the short-chain A\u00df (A\u00df1-14, A\u00df10-25, or A\u03b228-40) showed any agonistic or inhibitory effect on \u00df2-AR. Contrary, long-chain A\u00df-[Pyr]3-43, representing a major neurogenic plaque component, exerted an activation that after blocking by the \u00df2-AR antagonist ICI118.551, could be identified as that the effect was realized via the \u00df2-AR. Moreover, the long chain A\u00df1-40, A\u03b21-42, and A\u03b210-37, yet not the short-chain A\u00df peptides prevented the clenbuterol induced desensitization of the \u00df2-AR. In addition, we identified functional autoantibodies in the sera of AD patients, activating the \u00df2-AR, like the \u00df2-agAAb found in patients with glaucoma. As autoimmune mechanisms were reportedly involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and Alzheimer's Disease, we postulate that overstimulation of the \u00df2-AR pathway can induce an adrenergic overdrive, that may play an important role in the multifactorial interplay of neurodegenerative disorders.",

More recently, plasma biomarkers have been gaining recognition, but whether they exhibit similar differences is unclear. Furthermore, the underlying explanation for these differences in AD biomarkers is still unexplored.To investigate differences in plasma biomarkers by race and genetic ancestry and explore potential underlying explanations for these differences.This cross-sectional study used participant data from the Brain, Stress, Hypertension, and Aging Research Program (B-SHARP), an observational study conducted in the greater Atlanta metropolitan area. Participants were enrolled from March 1, 2016, to January 1, 2020.Main outcomes were plasma and CSF amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) 42, A\u03b240, phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and neurofilament light. General linear models were used for key comparisons.Main independent variables were self-identified race and genetic ancestry. Additional variables were cardiovascular factors, APOE4, educational attainment, Area Deprivation Index, and C-reactive protein (reflecting systemic inflammation state).This analysis included 617 participants (mean [SD] age, 66 [7.9] years; 300 [49%] African American and 317 [51%] White; 429 [70%] with mild cognitive impairment). On the basis of self-reported race, plasma levels of A\u03b242 (adjusted mean difference, -1.20 pg/mL; 95% CI, -2.33 to -0.07 pg/mL), A\u03b240 (adjusted mean difference, -37.78 pg/mL; 95% CI, -60.16 to -15.39 pg/mL), p-tau181 (adjusted mean difference, -4.66 pg/mL; 95% CI, -7.05 to -1.90 pg/mL), and neurofilament light (adjusted mean difference, -1.58; 95% CI, -2.83 to -0.19 pg/mL) were consistently lower in African American individuals after adjusting for demographic characteristics, educational attainment, cognition, APOE4, and cardiovascular factors. A similar pattern was observed in the CSF biomarkers except for A\u03b242 and A\u03b240. Although unadjusted analyses revealed an association between these biomarkers and African ancestry, these associations were not significant after adjusting for the same covariates. Differences by self-reported race were not explained by varied cardiovascular risk factors, C-reactive protein, educational attainment, or Area Deprivation Index.In this cross-sectional study of plasma biomarkers by race and genetic ancestry, the results indicated that plasma p-tau181, A\u03b240, and NFL were lower in African American individuals based on self-reported race but not genetic ancestry. These differences were not explained by cardiovascular risks or clinical stage differences. These racial differences should be considered in clinical interpretations and clinical trial screenings to avoid an additional increase in underrepresentation of African American individuals in AD trials.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "A chronic state of unresolved inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intrinsically involved with the remodeling of brain lipids. This review highlights the effect of carrying the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele (APOE4) on various brain cell types in promoting an unresolved inflammatory state. Among its pleotropic effects on brain lipids, we focus on APOE4's activation of Ca2+ -dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and its effects on arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid signaling cascades in the brain. During the process of neurodegeneration, various brain cell types, such as astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, together with the neurovascular unit, develop distinct inflammatory phenotypes that impact their functions and have characteristic lipidomic fingerprints. We propose that lipidomic phenotyping of single cell-types harvested from brains differing by age, sex, disease severity stage, and dietary and genetic backgrounds can be employed to probe mechanisms of neurodegeneration. A better understanding of the brain cellular inflammatory/lipidomic response promises to guide the development of nutritional and drug interventions for AD dementia.",

This study aimed to determine the effects of functional constipation on cognitive decline in community-dwelling older adults.This was a 2-year longitudinal analysis of Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study data, including 851 community-dwelling residents who participated in both the baseline and follow-up surveys. A neuropsychological test, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Assessment Battery (CERAD-K), and the Korean version of the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) were used to evaluate cognitive function. Functional constipation was defined according to the ROME IV criteria. An analysis of covariance was used to identify the association between functional constipation and cognitive decline.Among the 851 participants, 8.9% had functional constipation. The patients in the constipation group were more likely to have low physical activity (15.8% vs. 8.8%), polypharmacy (61.8% vs. 45.5%), and depression (30.3% vs. 17.4%) than the non-constipation group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, education years, low physical activity, polypharmacy, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, and baseline Cognitive Function Test score, the mean changes in Word Recognition test scores from 2018 to 2020 were -0.07 and -0.54 in the non-constipation and constipation groups, respectively (p=0.007). Other cognitive function tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, word list memory, word list recall, digit span, trail-making test, and FAB) did not show any difference in decline between the two groups (p&gt;0.05).Functional constipation at baseline was associated with a decline in word recognition after 2 years.",

Det er en progredierende nethindesygdom som gradvist f\u00f8rer til \u00f8delaeggelse af de celler som er ansvarlige for vores centralsyn. De tidlige stadier er ofte asymptomatiske, imens senstadie AMD, som opdeles i to former, neovaskulaer AMD (nAMD) og geografisk atrofi (GA), begge udviser gradvist synstab, dog generelt med forskellig hastighed. Tidlig AMD er karakteriseret ved tilstedevaerelsen af druser og pigmentforandringer i nethinden mens nAMD og GA udviser henholdsvis karnydannelse i og atrofi af nethinden. AEtiologien er multifaktoriel og udover alder omfatter patogenesen milj\u00f8- og genetiske risikofaktorer. Forskning har specielt fokuseret p\u00e5 lokale forandringer i \u00f8jet hvor man har fundet at inflammation spiller en betydelig rolle for udviklingen af sygdommen, men flere studier tyder ogs\u00e5 p\u00e5 at systemiske forandringer og specielt systemisk inflammation spiller en vaesentlig rolle i patogenesen. De Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasier (MPNs) er en gruppe af haematologiske kraeftsygdomme med en erhvervet genetisk defekt i den tidlige pluripotente stamcelle som medf\u00f8rer en overproduktion af en eller flere af blodets modne celler. Sygdommene er fundet at udvikle sig i et biologisk kontinuum fra tidligt cancerstadie, essentiel trombocytose (ET) over polycytaemi vera (PV) og endelig til det sene myelofibrose stadie (PMF). Symptomer hos disse patienter skyldes isaer den aendrede sammensaetning af blodet, hyperviskositet, kompromitteret mikrocirkulation og nedsat vaevsgennembl\u00f8dning. Den \u00f8gede morbiditet og mortalitet beror i h\u00f8j grad p\u00e5 tromboembolier, bl\u00f8dninger og leukemisk transformation. En raekke mutationer som driver MPN sygdommene er identificeret, bl.a. JAK2V617F-mutationen som medf\u00f8rer en deregulering JAK/STAT signalvejen, der bl.a. har betydning for cellers vaekst og overlevelse. Et tidligere stort registerstudie har vist at patienter med MPNs har en \u00f8get risiko for neovaskulaer AMD og et pilotstudie har vist \u00f8get forekomst af intermediaer AMD. Dette \u00f8nsker vi at unders\u00f8ge naermere i et st\u00f8rre studie i dette Ph.d.- projekt. Flere studier har ogs\u00e5 vist at kronisk inflammation spiller en vigtig rolle for b\u00e5de initiering og udvikling af den maligne celleklon hos MPNs og herfra er en \"Human Inflammationsmodel\" blevet udviklet. Siden er MPN sygdommene blevet anvendt som \"model sygdomme\" for en tilsvarende inflammationsmodel for udvikling af Alzheimers sygdom. I dette Ph.d.-projekt vil vi tilsvarende fors\u00f8ge at unders\u00f8ge systemisk inflammation i forhold til forekomst af druser. Det vil vi g\u00f8re ved at sammenligne systemiske immunologiske mark\u00f8rer som tidligere er unders\u00f8gt hos patienter med AMD og sammenligne med MPN. Specielt er vi interesseret i systemiske immunologiske forskelle p\u00e5 patienter med MPN og druser (MPNd) og MPN med normale nethinder (MPNn). Denne afhandling best\u00e5r af to overordnede studier. I Studie I, unders\u00f8gte vi forekomsten af retinale forandringer associeret med AMD hos 200 patienter med MPN (artikel I). Studie II, omhandlede immunologiske ligheder ved AMD og MPN, og var opdelt i yderligere tre delstudier hvor vi unders\u00f8gte hhv. systemiske mark\u00f8rer for inflammation, aldring og angiogenese (artikel II, III og IV). Vi unders\u00f8gte mark\u00f8rerne i fire typer af patienter: nAMD, intermediaer AMD (iAMD), MPNd og MPNn. Unders\u00f8gelsen af forskelle mellem MPNd og MPNn, vil g\u00f8re det muligt at identificere forandringer i immunsystemet som kunne vaere relevante for AMD-patogenesen. Vi vil endvidere sammenholde resultaterne for patienter med MPN med patienter som har iAMD og nAMD. I studie I (Artikel I) fandt vi at patienter med MPN har en signifikant h\u00f8jere praevalens af store druser og AMD tidligere i livet sammenlignet med estimater fra tre store befolkningsunders\u00f8gelser. Vi fandt ogs\u00e5 at forekomst af druser var associeret med h\u00f8jere neutrofil-lymfocyt ratio, hvilket indikerer et h\u00f8jere niveau af kronisk inflammation i patienterne med druser sammenlignet med dem uden druser. I studie II (Artikel II, III og IV) fandt vi flere immunologiske forskelle mellem patienter med MPNd og MPNn. Da vi unders\u00f8gte mark\u00f8rer for inflammation, fandt vi en h\u00f8jere grad af systemisk inflammation i MPNd end MPNn. Dette blev vist ved en h\u00f8jere inflammationsscore (udregnet p\u00e5 baggrund af niveauer af pro-inflammatoriske mark\u00f8rer), en h\u00f8jere neutrofil-lymfocyt ratio, samt indikationer p\u00e5 et dereguleret komplementsystem. Ved unders\u00f8gelse af aldringsmark\u00f8rer fandt vi tegn p\u00e5 accelereret immunaldring hos MPNd i forhold til MPNn, hvilket kommer til udtryk ved en st\u00f8rre procentdel af \"effector memory T celler\". Endelig fandt vi en vaesentlig lavere ekspression af CXCR3 p\u00e5 T celler og monocytter hos patienter med nAMD sammenlignet med iAMD, MPNd og MPNn. Dette er i overensstemmelse med tidligere studier hvor CXCR3 ekspression er fundet lavere end hos raske kontroller. Derudover fandt vi en faldende CXCR3 ekspression p\u00e5 monocytter over det biologiske MPN-kontinuum. Disse studier indikerer en involvering af CXCR3 i b\u00e5de nAMD og PMF, begge sygdomsstadier som er karakteriseret ved angiogenese og fibrose. Ud fra resultaterne af denne afhandling kan vi konkludere at forekomsten af druser og AMD hos MPN er \u00f8get i forhold til baggrundsbefolkningen. Endvidere viser vores resultater at systemisk inflammation muligvis spiller en vaesentlig st\u00f8rre rolle i udviklingen af AMD end tidligere antaget. Vi foresl\u00e5r derfor en AMD-model (Figur 18) hvor inflammation kan initiere og accelerere den normale aldersafhaengige akkumulation af affaldsstoffer i nethinden, som senere udvikler sig til druser, medf\u00f8rende \u00f8get lokal inflammation og med tiden tidlig og intermediaer AMD. Dette resulterer i den \u00f8gede risiko for udvikling til de invaliderende senstadier af AMD. ENGLISH SUMMARY: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness in high-income countries. It is a progressive retinal disease leading to damage of the cells responsible for central vision. The early stages of the disease are often asymptomatic, while late-stage AMD, which is divided into two entities, neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy (GA), both show vision loss, though generally with different progression rates. Drusen and pigmentary abnormalities in the retina characterise early AMD, while nAMD and GA show angiogenesis in and atrophy of the retina, respectively. The aetiology is multifactorial and, in addition to ageing, which is the most significant risk factor for developing AMD, environmental- and genetic risk factors are implicated in the pathogenesis. Research has focused on local changes in the eye where inflammation has been found to play an essential role, but studies also point to systemic alterations and especially systemic inflammation to be involved in the pathogenesis. The Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of haematological cancers with an acquired genetic defect of the pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell, characterised by excess haematopoiesis of the myeloid cell lineage. The diseases have been found to evolve in a biological continuum from early cancer state, essential thrombocythemia, over polycythaemia vera (PV), to the advanced myelofibrosis stage (PMF). The symptoms in these patients are often a result of the changes in the blood composition, hyperviscosity, microvascular disturbances, and reduced tissue perfusion. The major causes of morbidity and mortality are thromboembolic- and haemorrhagic events, and leukemic transformation. A group of mutations that drive the MPNs has been identified, e.g., the JAK2V617F mutation, which results in deregulation of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway important, for instance, in cell differentiation and survival. A previous large register study has shown that patients with MPNs have an increased risk of neovascular AMD, and a pilot study has shown an increased prevalence of intermediate AMD. We wish to study this further in a larger scale study. Several studies have also shown that systemic inflammation plays an essential role in both the initiation and progression of the malignant cell clone in MPNs. From this knowledge, a \"Human inflammation model\" has been developed. Since then, the MPNs has been used as model diseases for a similar inflammation model for the development of Alzheimer's disease. In this PhD project, we would like to investigate systemic inflammation in relation to drusen presence. We will do this by comparing systemic immunological markers previously investigated in patients with AMD and compare with MPN. We are primarily interested in systemic immunological differences between patients with MPN and drusen (MPNd) and MPN with normal retinas (MPNn). This thesis consists of two main studies. Study I investigated the prevalence of retinal changes associated with AMD and the prevalence of different AMD stages in 200 patients with MPN (paper I). Study II examined immunological similarities between AMD and MPNs. This study was divided into three substudies exploring systemic markers of inflammation, ageing and angiogenesis, respectively. This was done in four types of patients: nAMD, intermediate AMD (iAMD), MPNd and MPNn. Investigating, differences between MPNd and MPNn, will make it possible to identify changes in the immune system, relevant for AMD pathogenesis. Additionally, we will compare patients with MPNs with patients with iAMD and nAMD. In study I (Paper I), we found that patients with MPNs have a significantly higher prevalence of large drusen and consequently AMD from an earlier age compared to the estimates from three large population-based studies. We also found that drusen prevalence was associated with a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio indicating a higher level of chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with drusen compared to those without drusen. In study II (papers II, III and IV), we found immunological differences between patients with MPNd and MPNn. When we investigated markers of inflammation, we found a higher level of systemic inflammation in MPNd than MPNn. This was indicated by a higher inflammation score (based on levels of pro-inflammatory markers), a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and indications of a deregulated complement system. When examining markers of ageing, we found signs of accelerated immune ageing in MPNd compared to MPNn, shown by more senescent effector memory T cells. Finally, when exploring a marker of angiogenesis, we found a lower CXCR3 expression on monocytes and T cells in nAMD compared to iAMD, MPNd and MPNn, in line with previous studies of nAMD compared to healthy controls. Further, we found decreasing CXCR3 expression over the MPN biological continuum. These studies indicate CXCR3 involvement in both nAMD and PMF, two disease stages characterised by angiogenesis and fibrosis. From the results of this PhD project, we can conclude that the prevalence of drusen and AMD is increased in patients with MPN compared to the general population. Further, our results show that systemic inflammation may play a far more essential role in AMD pathogenesis than previously anticipated. We, therefore, propose an AMD model (Figure\u00a018) where inflammation can initiate and accelerate the normal age-dependent accumulation of debris in the retina, which later evolve into drusen, resulting in increased local inflammation, and over time early- and intermediate AMD. This results in the increased risk of developing the late debilitating stages of AMD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Objective The aim of our study was to investigate the active components and mechanism of action of rosemary volatile oil for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) using network pharmacology. Methods We obtained the constituents of the rosemary volatile oil by searching Chinese herbal systemic pharmacological databases and analytical platforms, and we constructed the constituent-target networks by predicting and screening the action targets of the rosemary volatile oil constituents using SwissTargetPrediction, metaTarFisher, and Pubchem. We obtained the AD-related targets using the Genecards, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases, and we constructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) using the STRING database in Venny 2.1.0 graph to screen the cross-targets by screening the core-acting targets. Cytoscape 3.8.2 software was used to construct a component-target-pathway network to screen the potential active components of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD and to predict the mechanism of action of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD in combination with existing pharmacological studies. We performed a gene ontology (GO) biological process and a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the targets of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD using R language and molecular docking using Discovery Studio 4.0 software to validate their biological activities. Results A network constructed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 26 potential active ingredients in the rosemary volatile oil. We retrieved a total of 10762 AD targets from Genecards and other used databases. Our GO enrichment analysis yielded 39 entries (P < 0.05), including 14 entries for biological processes, five entries for cellular composition, and 20 entries for molecular function. A total of 14 entries (P < 0.05) were then enriched in the KEGG pathway that primarily involved the IL-17 signaling pathway and the AGE-RAGE pathway. Conclusion The active components of rosemary volatile oil had good inhibition of the inflammatory response. This study provides a reference and guidance for the in-depth study of rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD.",

Progress has been made from first-generation to second-generation apolipoprotein-mimetic peptides. Understanding these peptides from the first generation to second generation is discussed in this review. First, we discussed the first-generation apolipoprotein-mimetic peptides structural feature and their therapeutic potentials. Further, we discussed the development of second-generation apolipoprotein-mimetic peptides, like dual-domain peptides and bihelical peptides. We conclude with a discussion on the emergence of second-generation apolipoprotein-mimetic peptides as potential candidates in different preclinical and clinical studies.",

The successful AD model of rats was screened with Morris water maze. The successful model rats were randomly divided into a model group and three doses of SSF treated group. The Morris water maze was used to detect the rats' learning and memory abilities. The real-time fluorescence quantitative (qPCR) was applied to assay the mRNA expressions of CaM, CamkIV and Ferritin, as well as the neuroplasticity factors of HuB, HuC and HuD. The Western blotting was used to measure the protein expressions of CaM, CamkIV, HuB/D, HuC+HuD and Ferritin in CaM-CamkIV-CREB signal pathway.Compared with sham group, the abilities of learning and memory in the model group were significantly impaired (P<0.01), and the mRNA or protein expressions of CaM, CamkIV, HuB, HuC, HuD, HuB/D, HuC+HuD and Ferritin in CaM-CamkIV-CREB signal pathway were abnormal changed in model group. However, the three doses of SSF can differently ameliorated the impaired learning and memory and regulate the abnormal expressions of mRNA or protein in rats' CaM, CamkIV, HuB, HuC, HuD, HuB/D, HuC+HuD and Ferritin induced by composited A\u03b2.The improvement of SSF on the learning and memory disorder induced by composited A\u03b2 is primarily derived from the positive regulation in CaM-CamkIV-CREB signal pathway and activation in neuroplasticity.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Across the past 20 years, advances in the field of pathogenesis have inspired researchers to look into novel pharmacological therapeutics that are more focused on the pathophysiological events of the disease (AD). This review article discussed the prior use of statins for prevention of Alzheimer's disease, which can help prevent the disease. Other drugs, such as memantine and donepezil, are available, but they cannot prevent the onset of AD in middle age. Based on available clinical data, the valuable effects of statins are mediated by alteration of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau metabolism, genetic and lifestyle risk factors along with other clinical aspects of AD. These findings suggested the use of statins in middle age may help to prevent Alzheimer's disease by modifying genetic and non-genetic risk factors in later stage of life. In the present review, we elaborated upon the modification of risk factors and amyloid metabolism in the development and progression of AD and their modulation through atorvastatin. Future directions in the research and treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients include the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) to change target expression, and researchers discovered decreased markers of oxidative stress in tissues affected by tau pathology in response to RNA interference treatment.",

This study focused on the relationship of A\u03b2 with macroglia and microglia, as these glial cells are hypothesized to play important roles in homeostasis and clearance of A\u03b2 in the AD retina. Significantly higher A\u03b2 load was found in AD compared to controls, and specifically in the mid-peripheral region. AD retina showed significantly less immunoreactivity against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamine synthetase (GS) compared to control eyes. Immunoreactivity against ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA-1), a microglial marker, demonstrated a higher level of microgliosis in AD compared to control retina. Within AD retina, more IBA-1 immunoreactivity was present in the mid-peripheral retina, which contained more A\u03b2 than the central AD retina. GFAP co-localized rarely with A\u03b2, while IBA-1 co-localized with A\u03b2 in more layers of control than AD donor retina. These results suggest that dysfunction of the M\u00fcller and microglial cells may be key features of the AD retina.",

However, these findings were uncertain because of survivor bias and a lack of stratification by cancer types. This current cohort study used data from the UK Biobank to explore these associations.Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine the association of cancer status and the risk of dementia with its subtypes after adjusting for age and sex. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as a measure of relative risk by comparing observed dementia incidence among cancer patients.We included 263,151 participants in the observational analysis. During a median follow-up of 9.18 years, dementia was diagnosed in 472 individuals with cancer and 3685 individuals without cancer, respectively. Cancer patients had lower risks of dementia (hazard ratio: 0.89, confidence interval: 0.81-0.98) and its subtypes (Alzheimer's disease [AD]: 0.85 [0.74-0.98]; vascular dementia [VD]: 0.81 [0.66-0.99]) in the Cox regression adjusted for age and sex. Individuals with cancers in the male genital system had substantially reduced risks of dementia (0.66 [0.46-0.93]) and AD (0.53 [0.29-0.97]) than those with cancers in other systems. Moreover, non-melanoma skin cancer and prostate cancer were associated with a reduced risk of dementia (0.79 [0.62-0.99]; 0.69 [0.49-0.97]), but not with AD or VD (P>0.05).The current study supported a negative association between cancer and dementia risk, and encourages further exploration of the mechanistic basis of this inverse relationship to improve understanding.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Resting heart rate (RHR) has been linked with an increased risk of dementia. However, evidence characterizing the associations of RHR with different dementia subtypes and their underlying mechanisms remains scarce. This study aims to investigate the relationships of RHR with different dementia types, cognitive function, and brain structural abnormalities.Three hundred thirty-nine thousand nine hundred one participants with no prior diagnosis of dementia from the UK biobank were analyzed. Cox regression and restricted cubic spline models examined the associations between RHR with all-cause dementia (ACD) and its major subtypes-Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). Logistic regression models assessed the associations of RHR with cognitive function, and linear regression models estimated the associations with hippocampal subfield volume and white matter tract integrity indexed by magnetic resonance imaging data.During an average of 3148 (\u00b1\u2009941.08) days of follow-up, 4177 individuals were diagnosed with dementia, including 2354 AD and 989 VaD cases. RHR \u2265 80bpm was associated with ACD (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.28, P < 0.001) and VaD (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08-1.54, P = 0.005) but not AD in multi-adjusted models. A 10-bpm increment of RHR demonstrated non-linear effects in VaD, consisting of J-shape relationships. Several heterogeneities were indicated in stratified analysis, in which RHR measures only showed associations with dementia incidents in relatively younger populations (age \u2264 65) and females. Apart from dementia analysis, elevated RHR was associated with worsening performance in fluid intelligence and reaction time of cognitive tasks, decreased hippocampal subfields volume, and poor white matter tract integrity.RHR is associated with increased risks of ACD and VaD but also presented with few heterogeneities across different sex and age groups. Elevated RHR also appears to have deleterious effects on cognitive function and is distinctively associated with volume reduction in hippocampal subfields and impaired white matter tract integrity.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Sex differences have been identified in many diseases associated with dysregulated immune responses, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), for which approximately two-thirds of patients are women. An accumulating body of research indicates that microglia may play a causal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. We hypothesised that sex differences in the transcriptome of human myeloid cells may contribute to the sex difference observed in AD prevalence. To explore this, we assessed bulk and single-nuclear RNA sequencing data sets generated from four human derived myeloid cell populations: post-mortem microglial nuclei, peripheral monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and induced pluripotent stem cell derived microglial-like cells (MGLs). We found that expression of AD risk genes, gene signatures associated with the inflammatory response in AD, and genes related to proinflammatory immune responses were enriched in microglial nuclei isolated from aged female donors without ante-mortem neurological disease, relative to those from males. In addition, these inflammation-associated gene sets were found to be enriched in peripheral monocytes isolated from postmenopausal women and in MDMs obtained from premenopausal individuals relative to age-matched males. Expression of these gene sets did not differ in MDMs derived from women whose blood was sampled across the menstrual cycle or in MGLs cultured with 17\u03b2-oestradiol. This suggests that the observed gene set enrichments in myeloid cells from women were not being driven by acute hormonal influences. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the increased prevalence of AD in women may be partly explained by a myeloid cell phenotype biased towards expression of biological processes relevant to AD.",

Educational programming related to community outreach with older adults may help inspire interest in future ADRD clinical careers, while increasing awareness of ADRD in the community and aiding recruitment of underrepresented participants into research studies.The Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (BU ADRC) created the BU ADRC Student Ambassador Program, where medical students, graduate students, and undergraduates interested in medicine completed a curriculum during the academic year that included six educational and three outreach events, including monthly dementia-focused didactic meetings and outreach focusing on Black participant recruitment. A pre-post program survey design was implemented to assess changes in students' knowledge of and attitudes toward dementia and related disorders.Between September 2015 and May 2020, thirty-seven students completed the program. Following program completion, students demonstrated increased knowledge of dementia and willingness to work with patients with dementia, as well as more positive attitudes toward patients and the role of empathy in physician practice. In terms of recruitment benefits, the students helped the BU ADRC reach older adults from underrepresented groups who could serve as participants in future research studies.The BU ADRC Student Ambassador Program can serve as a model for other clinical research programs who wish to encourage students to consider a career in a specific field.

Here, we demonstrate through in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo models, as well as human AD brain tissue, that X-linked ubiquitin specific peptidase 11 (USP11) augments pathological tau aggregation via tau deubiquitination initiated at lysine-281. Removal of ubiquitin provides access for enzymatic tau acetylation at lysines 281 and 274. USP11 escapes complete X-inactivation, and female mice and people both exhibit higher USP11 levels than males. Genetic elimination of usp11 in a tauopathy mouse model preferentially protects females from acetylated tau accumulation, tau pathology, and cognitive impairment. USP11 levels also strongly associate positively with tau pathology in females but not males. Thus, inhibiting USP11-mediated tau deubiquitination may provide an effective therapeutic opportunity to protect women from increased vulnerability to AD and other tauopathies.",

Genetic predictors of these autoimmune diseases were obtained from the largest and most recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genetic associations with clinically-diagnosed Alzheimer's disease were obtained from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project GWAS (21982 cases; 41944 controls); and with parental and sibling history of Alzheimer's disease from the UK Biobank GWAS (27696 maternal, 14338 paternal and 2171 sibling cases). MR estimates were obtained using inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger and weighted median. To address possible selection bias due to inevitably recruiting only survivors, the analysis was repeated in younger people, i.e., UK Biobank siblings and adjusting for competing risk of Alzheimer's disease.Of the 7 autoimmune diseases considered, liability to psoriasis and sarcoidosis were not associated with Alzheimer's disease. Some evidence was found for liability to multiple sclerosis being associated with higher risk and liability to Sjogren's syndrome with lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Associations found for liability to giant cell arteritis, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis were inconsistent in sensitivity analyses.Liability to multiple sclerosis and Sjogren's syndrome could be associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Notwithstanding the complexity by which cholesterol biology is governed in the mammalian brain, excess neuronal cholesterol is primarily eliminated by metabolic clearance via cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1). No methods are currently available for visualizing cholesterol metabolism in the living human brain; therefore, a noninvasive technology that quantitatively measures the extent of brain cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 could broadly affect disease diagnosis and treatment options using targeted therapies. Here, we describe the development and testing of a CYP46A1-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, 18F-CHL-2205 (18F-Cholestify). Our data show that PET imaging readouts correlate with CYP46A1 protein expression and with the extent to which cholesterol is metabolized in the brain, as assessed by cross-species postmortem analyses of specimens from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Proof of concept of in vivo efficacy is provided in the well-established 3xTg-AD murine model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where we show that the probe is sensitive to differences in brain cholesterol metabolism between 3xTg-AD mice and control animals. Furthermore, our clinical observations point toward a considerably higher baseline brain cholesterol clearance via CYP46A1 in women, as compared to age-matched men. These findings illustrate the vast potential of assessing brain cholesterol metabolism using PET and establish PET as a sensitive tool for noninvasive assessment of brain cholesterol homeostasis in the clinic.",

Today, more than 6 million Americans are living with AD and that number is expected to increase to 13.8 million by 2060. The progressive debilitating nature of this illness and the absence of disease-modifying treatments contributes to a substantial economic and societal burden on the healthcare system. In 2022, the estimated healthcare costs associated with AD treatment were $321 billion, with costs projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2050. These cost-of-care projections are based on direct healthcare costs and are likely underestimated because indirect costs associated with AD treatment are usually not included. Indirect costs such as loss in productivity, diminished quality of life, and an increasing dependence on informal unpaid care provided by family caregivers augments the economic and societal burden of this disease. As drug development continues to evolve, the emergence of disease-modifying therapy may help to offset the burden associated with AD-related dementia.

A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A\u03b2's isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual fibril assembly microscopic rate constants. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid-point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A\u03b2 histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A\u03b2, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A\u03b2 assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A\u03b2 into toxic oligomers and fibrils.",

The therapy of many neurodegenerative diseases has not yet progressed to the point where it is possible to alter the course of the disease. Mid-life hypertension is an important predictor of later-life cognitive impairment and brain neurodegenerative conditions. These findings highlight the pivotal role of preventing and managing hypertension as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. Autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric and sleep disturbances can arise in neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in blood pressure variability (BPV). The BPV itself can worsen the progression of the disease. In older people with neurodegenerative disease and hypertension, it is critical to consider 24-h blood pressure monitoring and personalized blood pressure therapy.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) varies based on gender. Due to the lack of early stage biomarkers, most of them are diagnosed at the terminal stage. This study aimed to explore sex-specific signaling pathways and identify diagnostic biomarkers of AD.Microarray dataset for blood was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database of GSE63060 to conduct differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis by R software limma. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted. Immune checkpoint gene expression was compared between females and males. Using CytoHubba, we identified hub genes in a protein-protein interaction network (PPI). Then, we evaluated their distinct effectiveness using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Support vector machine (SVM) and ten-fold cross-validation were used to further verify these biomarkers. Lastly, we confirmed our findings by using another independent dataset.A total of 37 female-specific DEGs and 27 male-specific DEGs were identified from GSE63060 datasets. Analyses of enrichment showed that female-specific DEGs primarily focused on energy metabolism, while male-specific DEGs mostly involved in immune regulation. Three immune-checkpoint-relevant genes dysregulated in males. In females, however, these eight genes were not differentially expressed. SNRPG, RPS27A, COX7A2, ATP5PO, LSM3, COX7C, PFDN5, HINT1, PSMA6, RPS3A and RPL31 were regarded as hub genes for females, while SNRPG, RPL31, COX7C, RPS27A, RPL35A, RPS3A, RPS20 and PFDN5 were regarded as hub genes for males. Thirteen hub genes mentioned above was significantly lower in both AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The diagnostic model of 15-marker panel (13 hub genes with sex and age) was developed. Both the training dataset and the independent validation dataset have area under the curve (AUC) with a high value (0.919, 95%CI 0.901-0.929 and 0.803, 95%CI 0.789-0.826). Based on GSEA for hub genes, they were associated with some aspects of AD pathogenesis.DEGs in males and females contribute differently to AD pathogenesis. Algorithms combining blood-based biomarkers may improve AD diagnostic accuracy, but large validation studies are needed.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The relationship of specific body composition in the thighs and brain amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition remained unclear, although there were growing evidence that higher muscle and fat mass in thighs had a protective effect against cardiometabolic syndromes. To determine whether muscle mass and fat mass in the thighs affected amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) positivity differently in relation to gender, we investigated the association of muscle mass and fat mass with A\u03b2 positivity using positron emission tomography (PET) in individuals without dementia.We recruited 240 participants (134 [55.8%] males, 106 [44.2%] females) without dementia \u226545 years of age who underwent A\u03b2 PET, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans of the hip in the health promotion center at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea. Lower extremity skeletal muscle mass index (LASMI) was measured using BIA, and gluteofemoral fat percentage (GFFP) was estimated using DEXA scans of the hip. We investigated the associations of LASMI and GFFP with A\u03b2 positivity using logistic regression analyses after controlling for age, APOE4 genotype, and cognitive stage.Higher muscle mass in the thighs, measured as LASMI (odds ratio [OR]=0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08 to 0.84, p=0.031) was associated with a lesser risk of A\u03b2 positivity in only females. Higher fat mass in the thighs, measured as GFFP (OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95, p=0.008) was associated with a lesser risk of A\u03b2 positivity in only males. However, the association between LAMSI (p for interaction= 0.810), GFFP (p for interaction= 0.075) and A\u03b2 positivity did not significantly differ by gender. Furthermore, LAMSI only negatively correlated with centiloid (CL) values in females (r=-0.205, p=0.037), and GFFP only negatively correlated with CL values only in males (r=-0.253, p=0.004).Our findings highlight the importance of recognizing that gender differences exist with respect to the specific body composition to potentially protect against A\u03b2 deposition. Therefore, our results may help in designing gender-specific strategies for controlling body composition to prevent A\u03b2 deposition.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Moderate physical exercise is conducive to the brains of healthy humans and AD patients. Previous reports have suggested that treadmill exercise plays an anti-AD role and improves cognitive ability by promoting amyloid clearance, inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, reducing oxidative stress level, alleviating brain inflammation, and promoting autophagy-lysosome pathway in AD mice. However, few studies have explored the relationships between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and proper exercise in AD. The current study was intended to investigate the mechanism by which the exercise-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase improves AD.Both wild type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice were divided into sedentary (WTC and ADC) and exercise (WTE and ADE) groups (n\u2009=\u200912 for each group). WTE and ADE mice were subjected to treadmill exercise of 12\u00a0weeks in order to assess the effect of treadmill running on learning and memory ability, A\u03b2 plaque burden, hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase.The results indicated that exercise restored learning and memory ability, reduced A\u03b2 plaque areas, inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein activated PI3K/Akt/Hsp70 signaling pathway, and improved the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (increased UCHL-1 and CHIP levels, decreased BACE1 levels) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.These findings suggest that exercise may promote the E3 ubiquitin ligase to clear \u03b2-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated Tau by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the hippocampus of AD mice, which is efficient in ameliorating pathological phenotypes and improving learning and memory ability.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been used widely as an alternative to conventional cigarettes and have become particularly popular among young adults. A growing body of evidence has shown that e-cigarettes are associated with acute lung injury and adverse effects in multiple other organs. Previous studies showed that high emissions of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) in aerosols were associated with increased usage of the same e-cigarette coils. However, the impact on lung function of using aged coils has not been reported. We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1\u00a0h (2 puffs/min, 100\u00a0ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the vaping aerosols increased with age of the nichrome coils starting at 1200 puffs. Mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols produced from 1800, but not 0 or 900, puff-aged coils caused acute lung injury, increased lung wet/dry weight ratio, and induced lung inflammation (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MIP-2). Exposure to vaping aerosols from 1800 puff-aged coils decreased heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation in mice compared to mice exposed to air or aerosols from new coils. In conclusion, we observed that the concentration of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) increased with repeated and prolonged usage of e-cigarette coils. Exposure to high levels of aldehyde in vaping aerosol was associated with acute lung injury in mice. These findings show significant risk of lung injury associated with prolonged use of e-cigarette devices.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Women older than 60 have a higher risk of dementia, aging-related cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) than the rest of the population. The main reason is hormonal senescence after menopause, a period characterized by a decline in estrogen levels. Since the effectiveness of drugs currently approved for the treatment of AD is limited, it is necessary to seek the development of new therapeutic strategies. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in AD patients and individuals with dementia in general. The supplementation of this vitamin in dementia patients might be an interesting approach for increasing the effectiveness of pre-existing medications for dementia treatment. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin D treatment associated with memantine and donepezil in female mice submitted to ovariectomy (OVX) for five months and subjected to a dementia animal model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated amyloid \u03b2eta (A\u03b21-42). For this purpose, Balb/c mice were divided into five experimental groups, which received 17\u202fdays of combined therapy with vitamin D, donepezil, and memantine. Then, animals were subjected to behavioral tests. OVX groups exhibited reduced levels of E2 in serum, which was not altered by the combined therapy. Higher levels of vitamin D3 were found in the OVX animals submitted to the triple-association treatment. Mice exposed to both OVX and the dementia animal model presented impairment in short and long-term spatial and habituation memories. Also, female mice exposed to A\u03b2 and OVX exhibited a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels, and an increase in tumor necrose factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) levels in the hippocampus. Besides, increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were observed, as well as a significant increase in immunoreactivity for GFAP, an astrocytes marker, in the hippocampus. Notably, triple-association treatment reversed the effects of the exposition of mice to A\u03b2 and OVX in the long-term spatial and habituation memories impairment, as well as reversed changes in TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, and GFAP immunoreactivity levels in the hippocampus of treated animals. Our results indicate that the therapeutic association of vitamin D, memantine, and donepezil has beneficial effects on memory performance and attenuated the neuroinflammatory response in female mice subjected to OVX associated with a dementia animal model.",

In this study, we investigate the neuronal insult attributable to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) as the models of DM-related AD to understand the effects exerted by calycosin on neurodegenerative changes both in vivo and in vitro studies and also studied the associated molecular mechanisms. The results reported herein revealed that the viability of the PC12\u00a0cells induced by AGEs increased when treated with calycosin. It was also observed that the learning and memory abilities of AGE-induced DM-related AD rats improved under these conditions. Analysis of the reported results indicates that calycosin can effectively down-regulate the activity of GSK-3\u03b2 to result in the reversal of the process of tau hyperphosphorylation, inhibit the expression of RAGE and BACE-1 proteins, resulting in a decrease in the production of \u03b2-amyloid and regulate the PGC-1\u03b1/TFAM signaling pathway to repair mitochondrial dysfunction.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases that characterized by the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2). Overexpressions of A\u03b2 could induce oxidative stress that might be a key insult to initiate the cascades of A\u03b2 accumulation. As a result, anti-oxidative stress and attenuating A\u03b2 accumulation might be one promising intervention for AD treatment. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a major component of lipophilic tanshinones in Danshen, is proven to be effective in several diseases, including AD. Due to the poor solubility in water, the clinical application of Tan IIA was limited. Therefore, a great number of nanoparticles were designed to overcome this issue. In the current study, we choose chitson as delivery carrier to load Tanshinone IIA (CS@Tan IIA) and explore the protective effects of CS@Tan IIA on the CL2006 strain, a transgenic C. elegans of AD model organism. Compared with Tan IIA monomer, CS@Tan IIA could significantly prolong the lifespan and attenuate the AD-like symptoms, including reducing paralysis and the A\u03b2 deposition by inhibiting the oxidative stress. The mechanism study showed that the protection of CS@Tan IIA was attenuated by knockdown of daf-16 gene, but not skn-1. The results indicated that DAF-16/SOD-3 pathway was required in the protective effects of CS@Tan IIA. Besides DAF-16/SOD-3 pathway, the Tan IIA-loaded CS nanoparticles might protect the C. elegans against the AD insults via promoting autophagy. All the results consistently suggested that coating by chitosan could improve the solubility of Tan IIA and effectively enhance the protective effects of Tan IIA on AD, which might provide a potential drug loading approach for the hydrophobic drugs as Tan IIA.",

We sought to perform a genome-wide association study of brain tau load as measured by AV1451 positron emission tomography (PET). Among 543 non-demented European individuals, novel associations with higher tau were identified for rs56298435 (p\u00a0=\u00a08.35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10, \u03b2=0.31) within ZBTB20, and for rs150532 (p\u00a0=\u00a01.90\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8, \u03b2=0.26) in the protein phosphorylation regulatory gene EYA4. The APOE association additionally reached genome-wide significant when APOE \u03b54 was not adjusted. Minor allele carriers of rs56298435 or rs150532 showed higher levels of tau PET load. As expected, phosphorylated-tau analyses in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid also revealed the same direction of effect. Functionally, the effects of novel loci on cognitive decline could be mediated by tau pathology. In addition, we observed that the expression of VNN2 as regulated by rs150532, together with EYA4, displayed significant correlations with the tau-related gene MAPT in numerous brain regions. Our novel finding lends additional credence to heritable underpinnings of tau deposition.",

Aluminum is recognized as a risk factor for the etiology, pathogenesis, and progression of AD. The present study was designed to determine the effects of p-coumaric acid (p-CA), a phenolic compound, on spatial cognitive ability and non-cognitive functions and to identify the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in an AD rat model induced by aluminum chloride (AlCl3).Both AlCl3 (100\u00a0mg/kg/day; P.O.) and p-CA (100\u00a0mg/kg/day; P.O.) treatments were given for six consecutive weeks. During the fifth and sixth weeks of the treatment period, the cognitive and non-cognitive functions of the rats were assessed using standard behavioral tests. Additionally, oxidative-antioxidative status, inflammatory markers, and histological changes were evaluated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal regions of the rats.The results of this study showed that AlCl3 exposure enhanced anxiety-/depression-like behaviors, reduced locomotor/exploratory activities, and impaired spatial learning and memory. These cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances were accompanied by increasing oxidative stress, enhancing inflammatory response, and neuronal loss in the studied brain regions. Interestingly, treatment with p-CA alleviated all the above-mentioned neuropathological changes in the AlCl3-induced AD rat model.The findings suggest that both anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of p-CA may be the underlying mechanisms behind its beneficial effect in preventing neuronal loss and improving cognitive and non-cognitive deficits associated with AD.",

Completion of all BHR modules was low (6%).Targeted ad placement, culturally tailored enrollment messaging, and culturally tailored BHR websites increased enrollment of Latino participants in BHR, but did not translate to increased module completion.Culturally tailored social marketing and website improvements were implemented. The efforts enrolled 5662 Latino individuals in 12.5 months. The number of Latino Brain Health Registry (BHR) participants increased by 122.7%. We failed to adequately enroll female Latinos and Latinos with lower education. Future work will evaluate effects of a newly released Spanish-language BHR website.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Petasites japonicus leaf extract inhibits Alzheimer's-like pathology through suppression of neuroinflammation.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Neuroinflammation is a crucial pathogenic process involved in the development and deterioration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Petasites japonicus is known for its beneficial effects on various disease states such as allergic reaction, oxidative stress and inflammation. However, it is still unknown whether P. japonicus has protective effects on neuroinflammation, especially microgliosis related to AD. The current study aimed to investigate whether an extract of P. japonicus (named KP-1) protects from microglial cell activation in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the anti-neuroinflammation effects of KP-1, the current study adopted the most widely used experimental models including the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microgliosis in vitro model and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) oligomer (A\u03b2O)-induced neuroinflammation in vivo model, respectively. As a result, KP-1 pre-treatment reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, protein levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in BV2 cells which were significantly promoted by 100 ng ml-1 LPS treatment. Similarly, KP-1 administration protected mice from A\u03b2O-induced memory impairment scored by Y-maze and novel object recognition test (NORT). Moreover, KP-1 administration suppressed A\u03b2O-induced microglial cell activation measured by counting the number of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive cells in both the cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus and measuring the mRNA expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Furthermore, A\u03b2O-induced synaptotoxicity was prevented by KP-1 administration which is in line with behavioral changes. Collectively, these findings suggest that KP-1 could be a potential functional food for protection against neuroinflammation, and prevents or delays the progression of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, we develops a platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) high-expression (MSC-EVs-SHP2). The high blood-brain barrier penetration ability of MSC-EVs-SHP2 is demonstrated in AD-mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC-EVs-SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. Our EV-engineering technology provide a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Brain Energy Metabolism: Astrocytes in Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the brain. They have many important functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including the maintenance of glutamate and ion homeostasis, the elimination of oxidative stress, energy storage in glycogen, tissue repair, regulating synaptic activity by releasing neurotransmitters, and participating in synaptic formation. Astrocytes have special highly ramified structure. Their branches contact with synapses of neurons inwardly, with fine structure and wrapping synapses; their feet contact with blood vessels of brain parenchyma outward, almost wrapping the whole brain. The adjacent astrocytes rarely overlap and communicate with each other through gap junction channels. The ideal location of astrocytes enables them to sense the weak changes of their surroundings and provide the structural basis for the energy supply of neurons. Neurons and astrocytes are closely coupled units of energy metabolism in the brain. Neurons consume a lot of ATPs in the process of neurotransmission. Astrocytes provide metabolic substrates for neurons, maintain high activity of neuron, and facilitate information transmission of neurons. This article reviews the characteristics of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism of astrocytes. The metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons, astrocytes and microglia were also detailed discussed. Finally, we classified analyzed the role of metabolic disorder of astrocytes in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "A new mechanistic approach to overcome the neurodegenerative disorders caused by oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly stressed in this article. Thus, a newly formulated drug (zinc ortho-methyl carbonodithioate (ZOMEC)) was investigated for five weeks on seven-week-old BALB/c male mice. ZOMEC 30\u2009mg/kg was postadministered intraperitoneally during the third week of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection. The brain homogenates of the mice were evaluated for their antioxidant potential for ZOMEC. The results including catalase (CAT), glutathione S transferase (GST), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) demonstrated that ZOMEC significantly reverted the oxidative stress stimulated by PTZ in the mouse brain. ZOMEC upregulated p-Akt/Nrf-2 pathways (also supported by molecular docking methods) to revoke PTZ-induced apoptotic protein markers. ZOMEC reversed PTZ-induced neuronal synapse deficits, improved oxidative stress-aided memory impairment, and inhibited the amyloidogenic pathway in mouse brains. The results suggested the potential of ZOMEC as a new, safe, and neurotherapeutic agent to cure neurodegenerative disorders by decreasing AD-like neuropathology in the animal PTZ model.",

Saffron is a traditional medicinal plant used as a food additive. The stigma of saffron has bioactive compounds such as safranal, crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, kaempferol, and flavonoid. These bioactive compounds can be extracted using conventional (maceration, solvent extraction, soxhlet extraction, and vapor or hydrodistillation) and novel techniques (emulsion liquid membrane extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, enzyme-associated extraction, pulsed electric field extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and supercritical fluid extraction). Saffron is used as a functional ingredient, natural colorant, shelf-life enhancer, and fortifying agent in developing different food products. The demand for saffron has been increasing in the pharma industry due to its protection against cardiovascular and Alzheimer disease and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antidepressant properties. Conclusively, the phytochemical compounds of saffron improve the nutrition value of products and protect humans against various disorders.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Cortical atrophy is associated with cognitive decline, but the association is not perfect. We aimed to identify factors explaining the discrepancy between the degree of cortical atrophy and cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired elderly.The discrepancy between atrophy and cognitive decline was measured using the residuals from a linear regression analysis between change in whole brain cortical thickness over time and change in a cognitive composite measure over time in 395 cognitively unimpaired participants from the Swedish BioFINDER study. We tested for bivariate associations of this residual measure with demographic, imaging, and fluid biomarker variables using Pearson correlations and independent-samples t-tests, and for multivariate associations using linear regression models. Mediation analyses were performed to explore possible paths between the included variables.In bivariate analyses, older age (r = -0.11, p = 0.029), male sex (t = -3.00, p = 0.003), larger intracranial volume (r = -0.17, p < 0.001), carrying an APOEe4 allele (t = -2.71, p = 0.007), larger white matter lesion volume (r = -0.16, p = 0.002), lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) 42/40 ratio (t = -4.05, p < 0.001), and higher CSF levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 (r = -0.22, p < 0.001), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; r = -0.15, p = 0.003), and neurofilament light (NfL; r = -0.34, p < 0.001) were negatively associated with the residual measure, i.e., associated with worse than expected cognitive trajectory given the level of atrophy. In a multivariate analysis, only lower CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio and higher CSF NfL levels explained cognition beyond brain atrophy. Mediation analyses showed that associations between the residual measure and APOEe4 allele, CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio, and CSF GFAP and p-tau181 levels were mediated by levels of CSF NfL, as were the associations with the residual measure for age, sex, and WML volume.Our results suggest that axonal degeneration and amyloid pathology independently affect the rate of cognitive decline beyond the degree of cortical atrophy. Furthermore, axonal degeneration mediated the negative effects of old age, male sex, and white matter lesions, and in part also amyloid and tau pathology, on cognition over time when accounting for cortical atrophy.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Increased expression of CD33 in the brain has been suggested to be associated with increased amyloid plaque burden, while the peripheral level of CD33 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and its role in AD remain unclear. The current study aimed to systematically explore the bidirectional relationship between peripheral CD33 and AD. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of AD (Ncases: 21982; Ncontrols: 41944), blood CD33 mRNA level, the plasma CD33 protein level, and CD33 expression on immune-cell subtypes were obtained from GWASs conducted in the European population. Eligible IVs were extracted from the GWASs. MR estimates were calculated by inverse-variance weighting (IVW) and other sensitivity analyses. The main statistical analyses were conducted using TwoSampleMR (v.0.5.5) in R package (V.4.1.2).In the forward MR analysis (CD33 as exposure and AD as outcome), the IVW results indicated that elevated blood CD33 mRNA level (OR [95% CI]\u2009=\u20091.156[1.080, 1.238], p\u2009=\u20093.25e-05), elevated serum CD33 protein level (OR [95% CI]\u2009=\u20091.08 [1.031, 1.139], p\u2009=\u20091.6e-03) and increased CD33's expression on immune cell subtypes (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were all leading to a higher risk of AD. And sensitivity analyses supported these findings. While the reverse MR analysis (AD as exposure and CD33 as outcome) indicated that AD was not leading to the elevation of CD33's protein level in the blood (p\u2009>\u20090.05). In conclusion, our results indicated that elevated peripheral expression of CD33 was causal to the development of AD. Future studies are needed to work on developing CD33 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in AD.",

We investigated whether the risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases were increased among patients with acromegaly using nationwide data of Korea.We studied the association between acromegaly and Parkinson's disease and dementia in 1,611 patients with acromegaly and controls (age- and sex-matched 8055 participants with no diagnosis of acromegaly) from the National Health Insurance System database between 2006 and 2016 with a mean follow-up period of 7.34 years. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the risk of all outcomes in patients with acromegaly compared with controls with adjusting for age, sex, household income, place, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.The average age of the acromegaly patients and the controls was 54.16 years old (40.4% men). The incidence rate of Parkinson's disease in patients with acromegaly (1.54 per 1,000 person-years) was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.55 per 1,000 person-years) (log-rank test p=0.001). Acromegaly was associated with a higher risk of Parkinson's disease (hazard ratio [HR]= 2.609, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.410 to 2.609) than the control. In addition, acromegaly was associated with a higher risk of all-cause dementia (HR=2.299, 95% CI: 1.362-3.881), Alzheimer`s disease (HR=2.228, 95% CI: 1.191-4.168) and Non-AD dementia (HR=6.553, 95% CI: 1.754-24.482) than the control during the first three years after diagnosis and treatment. In subgroup analysis, diabetes was associated with higher risk of all-cause dementia (P for interaction=0.028) in patients with acromegaly compared with controls.Our study results suggest that acromegaly is associated with neurodegenerative disease.

The presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB), which prevents medications from entering the brain, makes treating AD difficult. Currently, existing therapeutic modalities provide symptomatic alleviation while also being unsafe. Phytoconstituents are gaining popularity due to their neuroprotective properties and ability to target many pathogenic pathways involved with AD. However, because to their lower BBB permeability, poor solubility, and low bioavailability, they have failed to reduce disease progression and treat Alzheimer's disease. Nanotechnology is an emerging tool for overcoming these obstacles in brain drug delivery. Thus, the development of phytochemical-loaded nanocarrier systems can reduce these barriers while improving neuroprotective benefits. In this review, we summarised prospective targets, methodologies for brain drug delivery, phytoconstituents, and their nanocarrier system developed for the management and treatment of AD. Researchers looking for an alternate method to treat AD were given new insight by emphasising obstacles and future prospects.",

Rapamycin treatment reduced the burden of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated pathological tau in the cerebral cortex only when applied to young mice, prior to the emergence of pathology. Conversely, PQR530 which exhibits better brain exposure and superior pharmacokinetic properties, reduced tau pathology even when the treatment started after the onset of pathology. Our results show that dosing animals twice per week with PQR530 resulted in intermittent, rather than sustained target engagement. Nevertheless, this pulse-like mTOR inhibition followed by longer intervals of re-activation was sufficient to reduce tau pathology in the cerebral cortex in P301S tau transgenic mice. This suggests that balanced therapeutic dosing of blood-brain-barrier permeable mTOR-inhibitors can result in a disease-modifying effect in AD and at the same time prevents toxic side effects due to prolonged over activation of autophagy.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Recurrent seizure is a common comorbidity in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline. Similarly, many mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that overproduce amyloid beta are prone to epileptiform seizures that may result in early sudden death. We studied one such model, designated APP/PS1, and found that mutation of the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Mer or its ligand Gas6 greatly exacerbated early death. Lethality was tied to violent seizures that appeared to initiate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, where Mer plays an essential role in the microglial phagocytosis of both apoptotic and newborn cells normally generated during adult neurogenesis. We found that newborn DG neurons and excitatory synapses between the DG and the cornu ammonis field 3 (CA3) field of the hippocampus were increased in TAM-deficient mice, and that premature death and adult neurogenesis in these mice were coincident. In contrast, the incidence of lethal seizures and the deposition of dense-core amyloid plaques were strongly anticorrelated. Together, these results argue that TAM-mediated phagocytosis sculpts synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus, and that seizure-inducing amyloid beta polymers are present prior to the formation of dense-core plaques.",

The median (range) age of participants was 75 (65-105) years; 8769 participants (51.3%) were female and 8338 (48.7%) were male. In the optimal 1:1 matching analysis (n\u2009=\u20093154), White participants had a greater proportion of positive amyloid PET scans compared with Asian participants (181 of 313; 57.8%; 95% CI, 52.3-63.2 vs 142 of 313; 45.4%; 95% CI, 39.9-50.9, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and Hispanic participants (482 of 780; 61.8%; 95% CI, 58.3-65.1 vs 425 of 780; 54.5%; 95% CI, 51.0-58.0, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.003) but not Black participants (359 of 615; 58.4%; 95% CI, 54.4-62.2 vs 333 of 615; 54.1%; 95% CI, 50.2-58.0, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.13). In the adjusted model, the odds of having a positive amyloid PET scan were lower for Asian participants (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.37-0.59; P\u2009<\u2009.001), Black participants (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and Hispanic participants (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.79; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with White participants.Racial and ethnic differences found in amyloid PET positivity among individuals with MCI and dementia in this study may indicate differences in underlying etiology of cognitive impairment and guide future treatment and prevention approaches.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Nowadays, it is still quite challenging to achieve an early diagnosis of the Alzheimer disease (AD) in clinics. The burgeoning near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging fulfills the requirements for a precise diagnosis with good sensitivity and a high signal-to-background ratio and offers opportunities for the efficient AD diagnosis. As the pathogenesis of AD is quite complex, there is an ongoing exploration of advanced probes to specifically target AD biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, viscosity, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), reactive oxygen species, and methylglyoxal). To this end, a great number of small molecular fluorescent probes with good water solubility, blood-brain barrier crossing capability, and ease in tuning photophysical and biological properties have been studied for the AD diagnosis. Herein, we systematically update the progress of NIRF AD probes in the last three years. The special focus is on the mechanisms for the targeted diagnosis and the relationship between the structure and properties of the probes. Importantly, NIRF probes with complementary functions such as dual-responsiveness and multimodal imaging and even therapeutics are discussed. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives of the AD probes are briefly elucidated. We hope that this review provides guidance for researchers and expedites the preclinical and clinical study of the NIRF AD probes.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is an intractable disease, and the accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 in the brain is thought to be involved in the onset of the disease. Additionally, abnormal protein accumulation due to autophagic deficiency may also be involved in disease progression. Autophagy involves a mechanism called selective autophagy. However, the relationship between selective autophagy and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the interaction between p62, an adapter protein, and an APP-related molecule, and found that p62 interacted with the C-terminal fragment of APP (C60). When C60 and p62 are overexpressed, aggregates are formed, and C60 is degraded by autophagy. These aggregates cannot be easily degraded, even with a reducing agent. We also found that autophagosome- and lysosome-marker-positive vesicles were formed in the C60- and p62-expressing cells. Super resolution technology also revealed that p62-C60-positive autophagosomes were formed in the cells. Overall, these results suggest that p62 may bind with C60 to form aggregates and induce autophagy in autophagosomes. These results reveal one of the mechanisms underlying the progression of Alzheimer's disease, in which selective autophagy may be involved.",

HSV-1 antibodies were assayed in baseline sera collected from 2009-2015. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare outcomes by HSV-1 seropositivity and high HSV-1 IgG titres/IgM status.There was no association between baseline HSV-1 seropositivity and rates of cognitive decline or whole brain atrophy. Having high HSV-1 IgG titres/IgM was associated with a slightly greater decline in MMSE points per year (difference in slope\u2009-\u20090.365, 95% CI: -0.958 to -0.072), but not with rate of whole brain atrophy. Symptomatic mutation carriers declined fastest on both MMSE and BSI measures, however, this was not influenced by HSV-1. Among asymptomatic mutation carriers, rates of decline on MMSE and BSI were slightly greater among those who were HSV-1 seronegative. Among mutation-negative individuals, no differences were seen by HSV-1. Stratifying by APOE4 status yielded inconsistent results.We found no evidence for a major role of HSV-1, measured by serum antibodies, in cognitive decline or whole brain atrophy among individuals at high risk of early-onset AD.",

Patients underwent neuropsychological assessment, including the LASSI-L, and FDG-PET imaging. They were categorized as subjective memory complaints (SMC) (n=32), pre-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (Pre-MCI) (n=39), MCI due to AD (MCI-AD) (n=71), and MCI without evidence of neurodegeneration (MCI-NN) (n=13). Voxel-based brain mapping and metabolic network connectivity analyses were conducted.A significant group effect was found for all the LASSI-L scores. LASSI-L scores measuring failure to recover from proactive semantic interference and retroactive semantic interference were predicted by other neuropsychological tests with a precision of 64.1 and 44.8% . The LASSI-L scores were associated with brain metabolism in the bilateral precuneus, superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri, fusiform, angular, superior and inferior parietal lobule, superior, middle and inferior occipital gyri, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Connectivity analysis revealed a decrease of node degree and centrality in posterior cingulate in patients showing frPSI.Episodic memory dysfunction and the involvement of the medial temporal lobe, precuneus and posterior cingulate constitute the basis of the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference and retroactive semantic interference. These findings support the role of the LASSI-L in the detection, monitoring and outcome prediction during the early stages of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Advances in biomarkers, genetics, and other data used as dementia risk evidence (DRE) are increasingly informing clinical diagnosis and management. The purpose of this Mini-Forum is to provide a solutions-based discussion of the ethical and legal gaps and practical questions about how to use and communicate these data. Investigators often use DRE in research. When participants ask for their personal results, investigators have concerns. Will data that was intended to study groups be valid for individuals? Will sharing data cause distress? Debates around sharing DRE became heated when blood-based amyloid tests and amyloid reducing drugs appeared poised to enable clinicians easily to identify people with elevated brain amyloid and reduce it with a drug. Such an approach would transform the traditional role of DRE from investigational to foundational; however, then the high costs, uncertain clinical benefits and risks of the therapy led to an urgent need for education to support clinical decision making. Further complicating DRE use are direct to consumer genetic testing and increasingly available biomarker testing. Withholding DRE becomes less feasible and public education around responsible use and understanding become vital. A critical answer to these legal and ethical issues is supporting education that clearly delineates known risks, benefits, and gaps in knowledge, and communication to promote understanding among researchers, clinicians, patients, and all stakeholders. This paper provides an overview and identifies general concepts and resource documents that support more informed discussions for individuals and interdisciplinary groups.",

However, Hup-A causes some side effects. To search for new analogs or derivatives of Hup-A, we produced five Lycophyte alkaloids and two analogues by chemical synthesis: Lyconadins A-E, H-R-NOB, and 2JY-OBZ4.To systematically evaluated the therapeutic effects of the seven compounds on AD cell models.We assessed the effects of the seven compounds on cell viability via CCK-8 kit and used HEK293-hTau cells and N2a-hAPP cells as AD cell models to evaluate their potential therapeutic effects. We examined their effects on cholinesterase activity by employing the mice primary neuron.All compounds did not affect cell viability; in addition, Lyconadin A and 2JY-OBZ4 particularly increased cell viability. Lyconadin D and Lyconadin E restored tau phosphorylation at Thr231, and H-R-NOB and 2JY-OBZ4 restored tau phosphorylation at Thr231 and Ser396 in GSK-3\u03b2-transfected HEK293-hTau cells. 2JY-OBZ4 decreased the level of PP2Ac-pY307 and increased the level of PP2Ac-mL309, supporting that 2JY-OBZ4 may activate PP2A. Lyconadin B, Lyconadin D, Lyconadin E, H-R-NOB, and 2JY-OBZ4 increased sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 level in N2a-hAPP cells. 2JY-OBZ4 decreased the levels of BACE1 and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2, thereby reduced A\u03b2 production. Seven compounds exhibited weaker AChE activity inhibition efficiency than Hup-A. Among them, 2JY-OBZ4 showed the strongest AChE inhibition activity with an inhibition rate of 17% at 10\u03bcM.Among the seven lycophyte compounds, 2JY-OBZ4 showed the most expected effects on promoting cell viability, downregulating tau hyperphosphorylation, and A\u03b2 production and inhibiting AChE in AD.",

Neuroinflammation- and immune-related pathways represent one of the major genetic risk factors for AD.We aimed to investigate DNA methylation levels of 7 key immunologic-related genes in peripheral blood and appraise their applicability in the diagnosis of AD.Methylation levels were obtained from 222 participants (101 AD, 72 MC, 49 non-cognitively impaired controls). Logistic regression models for diagnosing AD were established after least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and best subset selection (BSS), evaluated by respondent working curve and decision curve analysis for sensitivity.Six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in the MCI group and 64 in the AD group were found, respectively.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Although the cause(s) of Alzheimer's disease in the majority of cases remains elusive, it has long been associated with hypertension. In animal models of the disease, hypertension has been shown to exacerbate Alzheimer-like pathology and behavior, while in humans, hypertension during mid-life increases the risk of developing the disease later in life. Unfortunately, once individuals are diagnosed with the disease, there are few therapeutic options available. There is neither an effective symptomatic treatment, one that treats the debilitating cognitive and memory deficits, nor, more importantly, a neuroprotective treatment, one that stops the relentless progression of the pathology. Further, there is no specific preventative treatment that offsets the onset of the disease. A key factor or clue in this quest for an effective preventative and therapeutic treatment may lie in the contribution of hypertension to the disease. In this review, we explore the idea that photobiomodulation, the application of specific wavelengths of light onto body tissues, can reduce the neuropathology and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease by controlling hypertension. We suggest that treatment with photobiomodulation can be an effective preventative and therapeutic option for this neurodegenerative disease.",

To evaluate the full utility of this diagnostic tool, information is needed on whether results from amyloid-\u03b2 PET scans influence care-partner outcomes.This study examines the extent to which previous disclosure of elevated amyloid (suggestive of Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology) versus not-elevated amyloid (not suggestive of AD etiology) is associated with changes in care-partner wellbeing.The study used data derived from a national longitudinal survey of Medicare beneficiaries (n\u200a=\u200a921) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and their care-partners. Care-partner wellbeing outcomes included depressive symptoms (PHQ-8), subjective burden (4-item Zarit burden score), and a 3-item measure of loneliness. Change was measured between 4 (Time 1) and 18 (Time 2) months after receiving the scan results. Adjusted linear regression models regressed change (Time 2-Time 1) in each outcome on scan result.Care-partners were primarily white, non-Hispanic, college-educated, and married to the care recipient. Elevated amyloid was not associated with statistically significant Time 1 differences in outcomes or with statistically significant changes in depressive symptoms 0.22 (-0.18, 0.61), subjective burden 0.36 (-0.01, 0.73), or loneliness 0.15 (-0.01, 0.32) for care-partners from one time point to another.Given advances in AD biomarker testing, future research in more diverse samples is needed to understand the influence of scan results on care-partner wellbeing across populations.",

This quantitatively confirmed the progression rates known in the literature. Then, we developed an approach based on deep learning model, DeepSurv, to predict the probabilities of time-to-conversion. Finally, to help interpret the deep learning model in our approach, we identified important variables contributing the most to the DeepSurv prediction, whose significance were validated with the analysis of variance (ANOVA).Our machine learning approach predicted the time to conversion with a high accuracy. For each of the different stages, the concordance index (CI) of our approach was at least 86%, and the integrated Brier score (IBS) was less than 0.1. To facilitate interpretability of the prediction results, our approach identified the top 10 variables for each disease conversion scenario, which were clinicopathologically meaningful, and most of them were also statistically significant.Our study has the potential to provide individualized prediction for future time course of AD conversions years before their actual occurrence, thus facilitating personalized prevention and intervention strategies to slow down the progression of AD.",

Time of day (TOD) effects have been confirmed in 1) healthy aging on cognitive processes such as inhibitory control, and 2) on behavior in AD (termed the sundowning effect), but no such research has addressed aMCI.The present study examined the impact of TOD on the behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of inhibition in 54 individuals with aMCI and 52 healthy controls (HCs), all of morning chronotype.Participants were randomly assigned to complete two inhibition tasks (Go-NoGo and Flanker) during their optimal (morning) or non-optimal (evening) TOD, while electroencephalography was recorded.Both tasks elicited changes in N2 and P3 event-related potential (ERP) components, which commonly index inhibitory functioning. Analyses showed that the Go-NoGo difference in P3 amplitude was reduced in individuals with aMCI relative to HCs. Compared to HCs, the Flanker difference in P3 amplitude was also reduced and coincided with more errors in the aMCI group. Notably, these behavioral and ERP differences were exaggerated in the non-optimal TOD relative to the optimal TOD.Findings confirm the presence of inhibition deficits in aMCI and provide novel evidence of sundowning effects on inhibitory control in aMCI. Results reinforce the need to consider the influences of TOD in clinical assessments involving individuals with aMCI.",

Passive immunotherapy targeting different tau species is a promising therapeutic approach. Age is one of the greatest risk factors; however, most immunotherapy studies are done in young to middle-aged mice tauopathy models, which is not representative of the many clinical trials done with older humans with established tauopathies.We utilized two different clones of tau oligomer monoclonal antibodies (TOMAs) in aged Htau and JNPL3 mouse models to investigate the potential of passive immunotherapy.Aged mice received a single intravenous injection of 120\u200a\u03bcg/animal of either TOMA1, TOMA3 clones or a non-specific IgG. Their cognitive functions were assessed one-week post-injection using Y-maze and novel object recognition tests. Brain tissues were analyzed using biochemical and immunological assays.TOMA 1 and 3 rescues cognitive phenotypes in aged animals in a mouse model-specific manner, indicative by a reduction in tau oligomers levels. The TOMAs were shown to have strong reactivity with different tau oligomeric species in the different mouse models in vitro and ex vivo.This is the first study testing tau passive immunotherapy in aged animals and supports our previous reports on of the role of oligomeric tau in disease progression further validating the potential of TOMAs to rescue the late-stage disease pathology and phenotype. Moreover, this study suggests that multiple tau oligomeric strains exist in aged animals; therefore, it is of great importance to further characterize these strains.",

Fifty-three mild-to-moderate AD patients were randomized, 27 in the PBM group and 26 in the sham group. All patients had 40 treatment sessions lasting 25\u200amin each over 8 weeks and were followed for 4 weeks afterwards. Compliance with the treatment was recorded. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events (AEs), and efficacy was evaluated using neuropsychological tests.The PBM therapy proved to be safe in regard to the number of recorded AEs (44% of the patients), which were balanced between the PBM and sham groups. AEs were mainly mild, and no serious AEs were reported. The majority of the patients (92.5%) were highly compliant, which confirms the feasibility of the PBM treatment.

Linear regression models were utilized to explore possible relationships of serum UA with cognition, disease duration, age, and age of onset.Compared to controls (355.48\u200a\u00b1\u200a85.38\u200a\u03bcmol/L), serum UA was significantly lower in AD (291.29\u200a\u00b1\u200a83.49\u200a\u03bcmol/L, p\u200a<\u200a0.001), PD (286.95\u200a\u00b1\u200a81.78\u200a\u03bcmol/L, p\u200a<\u200a0.001), PSP (313.32\u200a\u00b1\u200a88.19\u200a\u03bcmol/L, p\u200a<\u200a0.001), FTD (313.89\u200a\u00b1\u200a71.18\u200a\u03bcmol/L, p\u200a=\u200a0.001), and DLB (279.23\u200a\u00b1\u200a65.51\u200a\u03bcmol/L, p\u200a<\u200a0.001), adjusting for confounding factors including age, gender, education, etc. In addition, serum UA was positively correlated with cognitive levels in all patients (Mini-Mental State Examination: r\u200a=\u200a0.136, p\u200a=\u200a0.001; and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale: r\u200a=\u200a0.108, p\u200a=\u200a0.009).Decreased levels of serum UA were correlated with AD, PD, PSP, FTD, and DLB, offering significant potential as a promisingly relevant, less-invasive marker of multiple neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) was the main cause of dementia in an aging society; unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for AD now. Meditation has been reported to thicken the cerebral cortex, and gamma wave at a frequency of 40 hertz (Hz) was recorded during the meditation process from the brain. Previous study showed that non-invasive scintillation gamma frequency oscillation increased the space in recognition and memory of auditory cortex hippocampal gyrus in AD mice model. However, the AD-related molecular change by exposure of 40\u200aHz gamma frequency in brain cells was still unclear.We investigated the AD-related molecular change by exposure of 40\u200aHz gamma frequency in SH-SY5Y cells.We designed the light and sound generators at 40\u200aHz gamma frequency for this study. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to sound or light of 40\u200aHz gamma frequency, respectively. The concentrations of amyloid-\u03b240 (A\u03b240) and amyloid-\u03b242 (A\u03b242) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The protein levels were examined by western blotting. The aggregation of A\u03b242 was examined by thioflavin T assay.Our results showed that the secretion of A\u03b2, phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and tau, and aggregation of A\u03b242 were significantly inhibited by 40\u200aHz gamma frequency in SH-SY5Y cells. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, downstream of mTOR, was induced by 40\u200aHz gamma frequency in SH-SY5Y cells.Our study showed 40\u200aHz gamma frequency involved in the inhibition of secretion and aggregation of A\u03b2 and inhibition of p-Tau protein expression through the mTOR/4E-BP1/Tau signaling pathway.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The cascade of events that lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD) consists of several possible underlying signal transduction pathways. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and insulin receptor (IR) signaling are implicated in AD.We aimed to determine whether ASK1 activation and IR signaling impairment occurred prior to and during overt AD.Immunostaining, immunoblotting, and quantitative PCR were used to assess the levels of ASK1 and IR signaling intermediates. Glucose uptake was determined in AD-patient derived inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).ASK1 signaling was activated in postmortem brain tissues acquired from APOE4 carriers, a causative heritable factor, and in brain tissues of AD subjects in comparison with those harboring the normal APOE3 variant, which was manifested with an increased phosphorylated ASK1 (p-ASK1) and reduced thioredoxin 1 (TRX1). ASK1 downstream signaling effectors were also significantly elevated in these APOE4 carriers and AD brain tissues. Increased insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation at serine residues, and decreased p-AKT1, p-IR\u03b2, and GLUT3 expression were present in all APOE4 carriers and AD samples, suggesting impaired IR signaling leading to insulin resistance. ASK1 activation, IR signaling impairment, and GLUT3 reduction were also present in young AD transgenic mice prior to AD syndromes, AD mice at AD neuropathology onset, and AD iPSCs and their derived neurons prior to p-Tau aggregation.We conclude that the activation of oxidative stress-responsive kinases and reduced IR signaling precede and are persistent in AD pathogenesis. Our data further suggest possible crosstalk between ASK1 signaling and insulin resistance in AD etiology.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Difficulty understanding speech is a common complaint of older adults. In quiet, speech perception is often assumed to be relatively automatic. However, higher-level cognitive processes play a key role in successful communication in noise. Limited cognitive resources in adults with dementia may therefore hamper word recognition.The goal of this study was to determine the impact of mild dementia on spoken word recognition in quiet and noise.Participants were 53-86 years with (n\u200a=\u200a16) or without (n\u200a=\u200a32) dementia symptoms as classified by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Participants performed a word identification task with two levels of word difficulty (few and many similar sounding words) in quiet and in noise at two signal-to-noise ratios, +6 and +3\u200adB. Our hypothesis was that listeners with mild dementia symptoms would have more difficulty with speech perception in noise under conditions that tax cognitive resources.Listeners with mild dementia symptoms had poorer task accuracy in both quiet and noise, which held after accounting for differences in age and hearing level. Notably, even in quiet, adults with dementia symptoms correctly identified words only about 80% of the time. However, word difficulty was not a factor in task performance for either group.These results affirm the difficulty that listeners with mild dementia may have with spoken word recognition, both in quiet and in background noise, consistent with a role of cognitive resources in spoken word identification.",

We previously reported high prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in Somali immigrants seen at an academic medical center in Minnesota.To determine the prevalence of chronic viral hepatitis in Somali immigrants in Minnesota through a community-based screening program.We conducted a prospective community-based participatory research study in the Somali community in Minnesota in partnership with community advisory boards, community clinics and local mosques between November 2010 and December 2015 (data was analyzed in 2020). Serum was tested for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antibody and anti-HCV antibody.Of 779 participants, 15.4% tested positive for chronic HBV infection, 50.2% for prior exposure to HBV and 7.6% for chronic HCV infection. Calculated age-adjusted frequencies in males and females for chronic HBV were 12.5% and 11.6%; for prior exposure to HBV were 44.8% and 41.3%; and for chronic HCV were 6.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Seven participants developed incident HCC during follow up.Chronic HBV and HCV are major risk factors for liver disease and HCC among Somali immigrants, with prevalence of both infections substantially higher than in the general United States population.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation therapy that uses short, repetitive shockwaves through a neuro-navigated device. Current research suggests that these pulses lead to a wide range of vascular, metabolic, and neurotrophic changes. This relatively new CE-marked treatment provided first promising results in a clinical pilot study for improving cognition in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's. Data from other centers is lacking, so here we analyzed safety and pilot real-world short-term results of TPS from the first center in Germany. To gain information about effects in different stages, patients with not only mild but also moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's were analyzed.A total of 11 patients were retrospectively examined for cognitive and emotional function before and after the first stimulation series. The effect was assessed using several neuropsychological tests [Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), including the ADAS cognitive score (ADAS Cog) and ADAS affective scores, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] including in comparison between the groups of mild-to-severe patients. Moreover, subjective improvement of symptom severity, potential effects on depressive symptoms, and side effects were analyzed using Numeric Rating Scales (NRS).Side effects were rare (in 4% of sessions) with moderate subjective severity and only transient. Patients significantly improved in the ADAS and ADAS Cog, while there was no significant effect in MMSE and MoCA. Patients' self-reported symptom severity improved significantly. The depressive symptoms measured in an ADAS subscale also improved significantly. Statistical data analyses revealed no significant correlation of clinical improvement with baseline symptom severity.TPS might be a safe and promising add-on therapy for Alzheimer's, even for moderate-to-severe patients. More research on long-term effects in patients as well as studies with sham control groups is needed. Moreover, translational research on the mechanisms of action and effects on cerebral network physiology will be needed to understand this new neuromodulation technique.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The existing dementia risk models are limited to known risk factors and traditional statistical methods. We aimed to employ machine learning (ML) to develop a novel dementia prediction model by leveraging a rich-phenotypic variable space of 366 features covering multiple domains of health-related data.In this longitudinal population-based cohort of the UK Biobank (UKB), 425,159 non-demented participants were enrolled from 22 recruitment centres across the UK between March 1, 2006 and October 31, 2010. We implemented a data-driven strategy to identify predictors from 366 candidate variables covering a comprehensive range of genetic and environmental factors and developed the ML model to predict incident dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) within five, ten, and much longer years (median 11.9 [Interquartile range 11.2-12.5] years).During a follow-up of 5,023,337 person-years, 5287 and 2416 participants developed dementia and AD, respectively. A novel UKB dementia risk prediction (UKB-DRP) model comprising ten predictors including age, ApoE \u03b54, pairs matching time, leg fat percentage, number of medications taken, reaction time, peak expiratory flow, mother's age at death, long-standing illness, and mean corpuscular volume was established. Our prediction model was internally evaluated based on five-fold cross-validation on discrimination and calibration, and it was further compared with existing prediction scales. The UKB-DRP model can achieve high discriminative accuracy in dementia (AUC 0.848 \u00b1 0.007) and even better in AD (AUC 0.862 \u00b1 0.015). The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.92), and the predictive power was solid in different incidence time groups. More importantly, our model presented an apparent superiority over existing models like Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia Risk Score (AUC 0.705 \u00b1 0.008), the Dementia Risk Score (AUC 0.752 \u00b1 0.007), and the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (AUC 0.584 \u00b1 0.017). The model was internally validated in the general population of European ancestry and White ethnicity; thus, further validation with independent datasets is necessary to confirm these findings.Our ML-based UKB-DRP model incorporated ten easily accessible predictors with solid predictive power for incident dementia and AD within five, ten, and much longer years, which can be used to identify individuals at high risk of dementia and AD in the general population.This study was funded by grants from the Science and Technology Innovation 2030 Major Projects (2022ZD0211600), National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1312904, 2019YFA070950), National Natural Science Foundation of China (282071201, 81971032, 82071997), Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (2018SHZDZX01), Research Start-up Fund of Huashan Hospital (2022QD002), Excellence 2025 Talent Cultivation Program at Fudan University (3030277001), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (21QA1408700), Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University (yg2021-013), and the 111 Project (No. B18015).",

Despite growing publications on positive aspects of caregiving in dementia, few studies have identified the extent, nature, and gaps in the existing literature based on a holistic view. The aim was to identify key issues and a holistic view of literature regarding positive aspects of caregiving in dementia.A scoping review was conducted underlying a five-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Five databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science, were searched, and references were listed accordingly. Data were extracted by two researchers, comprising article characteristics, forms of positive aspects of caregiving and measurements, theories, forms of dementia and family caregiver, and keywords. Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were performed to analyze data. Network analysis of keywords and authors was conducted using VOSviewer software. Word cloud analysis of titles was examined by NVivo.The review included 230 articles, most of which have been published in the last decade (62.61%). Most articles (40.00%) were contributed by the United States. Cross-sectional studies (41.30%) ranked first, followed by qualitative studies (13.48%). Over a quarter of the literature (28.26%) focused on Alzheimer's care, and nearly 90% included all forms of family caregivers. The Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale and stress coping theory were most frequently cited. Four clusters dominated by Casey D, Quinn C, Joling KJ, and Teahan A were identified in the network of co-authorship. Six themes were identified: current situations of caregiver experiences, antecedents, consequences, measurement development, effects of interventions, and the concept of positive aspects of caregiving. These were in line with network analysis of keywords and word cloud analysis of titles.Positive aspects of caregiving in dementia have been widely concerned, but most of them are based on the theory of the negative stress process and are limited to current situations and influencing factors. Building theories focus on the positive aspects of caregiving, subsequently developing a comprehensive measurement and effective interventions, should be further studied.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta (A\u03b2)42 and tau levels have been revealed decades before symptoms onset in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the examination is usually invasive and inaccessible to most people. We thus aimed to develop a non-invasive behavioral test that targets early potential cognitive changes to gauge cognitive decline. Specifically, we hypothesized that older cognitive healthy participants would exhibit comparable performance when the task was explicit and relied on conscious cognition. However, when the task was implicit, the performance of participants at high and low risks for AD would bifurcate. That is, early changes in unconscious cognition could be linked to cognitive health.We measured implicit interference elicited by an imperceptible distractor in cognitively healthy elderly participants with normal (low risk) and pathological (high risk) A\u03b242/total tau ratio. Participants were required to perform a Stroop task (word-naming or color-naming on an ink-semantics inconsistent word) with a visually masked distractor presented prior to the target task.We found that, under a high-effort task (i.e., color-naming in the Stroop task), high-risk participants suffered interference when the imperceptible distractor and the subsequent target were incongruent in the responses they triggered. Their reaction times were slowed down by approximately 4%. This implicit interference was not found in the low-risk participants.These findings indicate that weakened inhibition of distracting implicit information can be a potential behavioral biomarker of early identification of AD pathology. Our study thus offers a new experimental paradigm to reveal early pathological aging by assessing how individuals respond to subperceptual threshold visual stimuli.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "To determine whether slowed gait and weakened grip strength independently, or together, better identify risk of cognitive decline or dementia.Time to walk 3\u00a0meters and grip strength were measured in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial involving community-dwelling, initially cognitively healthy older adults (N\u00a0=\u00a019,114).Over a median 4.7 years follow-up, slow gait and weak grip strength at baseline were independently associated with risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a01.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.73; and 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04-1.50, respectively) and cognitive decline (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.38, 95% CI: 1.26-1.51; and 1.04, 95% CI: 0.95-1.14, respectively) and when combined, were associated with 79% and 43% increase in risk of dementia and cognitive decline, respectively. Annual declines in gait and in grip over time showed similar results.Gait speed and grip strength are low-cost markers that may be useful in the clinical setting to help identify and manage individuals at greater risk, or with early signs, of dementia, particularly when measured together.Grip strength and gait speed are effective predictors and markers of dementia.Dementia risk is greater than cognitive decline risk with declines in gait or grip.Decline in gait speed, more so than in grip strength, predicts greater dementia risk.Greater risk prediction results from combining grip strength and gait speed.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a distinctive medical condition characterized by loss of memory, orientation, and cognitive impairments, which is an exceptionally universal form of neurodegenerative disease. The statistical data suggested that it is the 3rd major cause of death in older persons. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors play a vital role in the treatment of AD. Coumarins, natural derivatives, are reported as cholinesterase inhibitors and emerges as a promising scaffold for design of ligands targeting enzymes and pathological alterations related to AD. In this regard, the 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were developed for coumarin scaffold containing BChE and AChE inhibitors. Several 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were developed with FAST, BEST, and CEASER methods, and finally, statistically robust models (based on correlation coefficient, cost value, and RMSE value) were selected for further analysis for both targets. The important features ((HBA 1, HBA 2, HY, RA (BChE) HBA 1, HBA 2, HY, PI, (AChE)) were identified for good inhibitory activity of coumarin derivatives. Finally, the selected models were applied to various database compounds to find potential BChE and AChE inhibitors, and we found 13 for BChE and 1 potent compound for AChE with an estimated activity of IC50\u2009<\u200910\u00a0\u00b5M. Further, the Lipinski filters, and ADMET analysis supports the selected compounds to become a drug candidate. These selected BChE and AChE inhibitors can be used in the treatment of AD.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-022-00133-1.",

Wrist accelerometry could be a versatile tool for making objective, quantitative, and long-term assessments. The objective of this review was to summarise the clinical application of wrist accelerometry to agitation assessments and ways of analysing the data. Two authors independently searched the electronic databases CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Nine (n = 9) articles were eligible for a review. Our review found a significant association between the activity levels (frequency and entropy) measured by accelerometers and the benchmark instrument of agitated behaviour. However, the performance of wrist accelerometry in identifying the occurrence of agitation episodes was unsatisfactory. Elderly people with dementia have also been monitored in existing studies by investigating the at-risk time for their agitation episodes (daytime and evening). Consideration may be given in future studies on wrist accelerometry to unifying the parameters of interest and the cut-off and measurement periods, and to using a sampling window to standardise the protocol for assessing agitated behaviour through wrist accelerometry.",

The NEO-FFI-R, COPE, and HADS tests evaluated personality, coping strategies, and psychological distress, respectively.Anxiety and depression were below the cut-off point for mild severity. Conscientiousness and Agreeableness were the most preponderant personality factors, while Neuroticism was the least. Positive reinterpretation and Acceptance were the most frequent coping strategies, and Denial and Alcohol and drug use were the least used. Ongoing medical pathologies increased depression, while psychiatric disorders worsened psychological distress.Contrary to our expectations, PICOGEN candidates showed psychological distress and personality traits within normative ranges, and the use of problem-focused coping strategies prevailed over avoidance coping strategies. Nevertheless, clinicians should pay particular attention to individuals attending genetic counseling who are women, aged, and present an ongoing psychiatric disorder and psychiatric history at inclusion to ensure their mental health and adherence throughout the process.",

Numerous observational studies have investigated metformin and dementia risk, but have reported inconsistent findings, some of which might be caused by unaddressed time-related biases. Immortal time bias biases the results toward a \"protective\" effect, whereas time-lag and time-window biases can lead to either a \"detrimental\" or \"protective\" effect.To conduct a systematic review examining time-related biases in the literature on metformin and dementia.The electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and ProQuest were searched for the terms \"Metformin\" AND (\"dementia\" OR \"Alzheimer's Disease\" OR \"cognitive impairment\"). These databases were searched from inception through 09/24/2021. Only English language articles and human research were eligible.Seventeen studies were identified: thirteen cohort studies, two case-control studies, and two nested case-control studies. Eleven (64.7%) studies reported a reduced risk of dementia associated with metformin use; two (11.8%) suggested metformin increased dementia risk, while four (23.5%) concluded no significant associations. Eight (61.5%) of thirteen cohort studies had immortal time bias or did not clearly address it. Fifteen (88.2%) of seventeen reviewed studies had time-lag bias or did not clearly address it. Two (50.0%) of four case-control studies did not explicitly address time-window bias.

However, a better understanding of how temporal structures differ across atypical AD phenotypes and relate to cognition is needed.Our goal was to compare temporal lobe regions between tAD and two atypical AD phenotypes (logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)), and assess cognitive associations.We age and gender-matched 77 tAD participants to 50 LPA and 27 PCA participants, all of which were amyloid-positive. We used linear mixed-effects models to compare FreeSurfer-derived hippocampal volumes and cortical thickness of entorhinal, inferior and middle temporal, and fusiform gyri, and to assess relationships between imaging and memory, naming, and visuospatial function across and within AD phenotype.Hippocampal volume and entorhinal thickness were smaller bilaterally in tAD than LPA and PCA. PCA showed greater right inferior temporal and bilateral fusiform thinning and LPA showed greater left middle and inferior temporal and left fusiform thinning. Atypical AD phenotypes differed with greater right hemisphere thinning in PCA and greater left hemisphere thinning in LPA. Verbal and visual memory related most strongly to hippocampal volume; naming related to left temporal thickness; and visuospatial related to bilateral fusiform thickness. Fewer associations remained when examined within AD group.Atypical AD phenotypes are associated with greater thinning of lateral temporal structures, with relative sparing of medial temporal lobe, compared to tAD. These findings may have implications for future clinical trials in AD.",

The neuroprotective effects of berberine and Berberis vulgaris (barberry) root extract against apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the human SH-SY5Y cell line were studied.The methanolic extraction of barberry root was performed using a maceration procedure. Oxidative stress was induced in SH-SY5Y cells by H2O2, and an MTT assay was applied to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of berberine and barberry root extract. The cells were pretreated with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each compound (including berberine, barberry root extract, and H2O2), and the anti-apoptotic effects of all components were investigated using RT-PCR.The SH-SY5Y cell viability increased in both groups exposed to 75 and 150 ppm barberry extract compared with that in the H2O2-treated group. The data showed that exposing SH-SY5Y cells to 30 ppm berberine significantly increased the cell viability compared with the H2O2-treated group; treatment with 150 and 300 ppm berberine and H2O2 significantly decreased the SH-SY5Y cell viability and was associated with berberine cytotoxicity. The mRNA levels of Bax decreased significantly under treatment with berberine at 30 ppm compared with the control group. A significant increase in Bcl-2 expression was observed only after treatment with the IC50 of berberine. The expression level of Bcl-2 in cells exposed to both berberine and barberry extracts was also significantly higher than that in cells exposed to H2O2.The outcomes of this study suggest that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with barberry extract and berberine could suppress apoptosis by regulating the actions of Bcl-2 family members.",

At least twice as many have been infected but remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. COVID-19 includes central nervous system manifestations mediated by inflammation and cerebrovascular, anoxic, and/or viral neurotoxicity mechanisms. More than one third of patients with COVID-19 develop neurologic problems during the acute phase of the illness, including loss of sense of smell or taste, seizures, and stroke. Damage or functional changes to the brain may result in chronic sequelae. The risk of incident cognitive and neuropsychiatric complications appears independent from the severity of the original pulmonary illness. It behooves the scientific and medical community to attempt to understand the molecular and/or systemic factors linking COVID-19 to neurologic illness, both short and long term.This article describes what is known so far in terms of links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. We focus on risk factors and possible molecular, inflammatory, and viral mechanisms underlying neurological injury. We also provide a comprehensive description of the Alzheimer's Association Consortium on Chronic Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (CNS SC2) harmonized methodology to address these questions using a worldwide network of researchers and institutions.Successful harmonization of designs and methods was achieved through a consensus process initially fragmented by specific interest groups (epidemiology, clinical assessments, cognitive evaluation, biomarkers, and neuroimaging). Conclusions from subcommittees were presented to the whole group and discussed extensively. Presently data collection is ongoing at 19 sites in 12 countries representing Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe.The Alzheimer's Association Global Consortium harmonized methodology is proposed as a model to study long-term neurocognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The following review describes what is known so far in terms of molecular and epidemiological links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and AD and related dementias (ADRD)The primary objective of this large-scale collaboration is to clarify the pathogenesis of ADRD and to advance our understanding of the impact of a neurotropic virus on the long-term risk of cognitive decline and other CNS sequelae. No available evidence supports the notion that cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a form of dementia (ADRD or otherwise). The longitudinal methodologies espoused by the consortium are intended to provide data to answer this question as clearly as possible controlling for possible confounders. Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.The proposed harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology, determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and vascular disease.We provide a framework for current and future studies to be carried out within the Consortium. and offers a \"green paper\" to the research community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low- and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data on the topic.The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19 neuropsychiatric sequelae. We expect that deep phenotyping of neuropsychiatric sequelae may provide a series of candidate syndromes with phenomenological and biological characterization that can be further explored. By generating high-quality harmonized data across sites we aim to capture both descriptive and, where possible, causal associations.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Dual-targeted magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles reduce brain amyloid-\u03b2 burden via depolymerization and intestinal metabolism.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Rationale: Active removal of excess peripheral amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) can potentially treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the peripheral clearance of A\u03b2 using an anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) cannot remove PET-detectable A\u03b2 within the brain. This may be due to the inability of mAb to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to degrade insoluble brain A\u03b2 plaques and block liver dysfunction. Methods: We developed a dual-targeted magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (HA-MMSN-1F12) through surface-coupled A\u03b242-targeting antibody 1F12 and CD44-targeting ligand hyaluronic acid (HA). Results: HA-MMSN-1F12 had a high binding affinity toward A\u03b242 oligomers (Kd = 1.27 \u00b1 0.34 nM) and revealed robust degradation of A\u03b242 aggregates. After intravenous administration of HA-MMSN-1F12 into ten-month-old APP/PS1 mice for three weeks (4 mg/kg/week), HA-MMSN-1F12 could cross the BBB and depolymerize brain A\u03b2 plaques into soluble A\u03b2 species. In addition, it also avoided hepatic uptake and excreted captured A\u03b2 species through intestinal metabolism, thereby reducing brain A\u03b2 load and neuroinflammation and improving memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, the biochemical analysis showed that HA-MMSN-1F12 did not detect any toxic side effects on the liver and kidney. Thus, the efficacy of HA-MMSN-1F12 is associated with the targeted degradation of insoluble brain A\u03b2 plaques, avoidance of non-specific hepatic uptake, and excretion of peripheral A\u03b2 through intestinal metabolism. Conclusions: The study provides a new avenue for treating brain diseases by excreting disease-causing biohazards using intestinal metabolism.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "High blood pressure is a well-established risk factor of dementia. However, the timing of the risk remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to compare trajectories of systolic blood pressure (SBP) over a 35-year follow-up period in the Health Survey in Tr\u00f8ndelag (HUNT) from study wave 1 to 4 in people with and without a dementia diagnosis at wave 4 (HUNT4). This is a retrospective cohort study of participants aged \u2265 70 years in HUNT4, where 9,720 participants were assessed for dementia. In the HUNT study all residents aged \u2265 20 years have been invited to four surveys: HUNT1 1984-86, HUNT2 1995-97, HUNT3 2006-08 and HUNT4 2017-19. The study sample was aged 70-102 years (mean 77.6, SD 6.0) at HUNT4, 54% were women and 15.5% had dementia, 8.8% had Alzheimer's disease (AD), 1.6% had vascular dementia (VaD) and 5.1% had other types of dementia. Compared to those without dementia at HUNT4, those with dementia at HUNT4 had higher SBP at HUNT1 and HUNT2, but lower SBP at HUNT4. These differences at HUNT1 and 2 were especially pronounced among women. Results did not differ across birth cohorts. For dementia subtypes at HUNT4, the VaD group had a higher SBP than the AD group at HUNT2 and 3. Age trajectories in SBP showed that the dementia group experienced a steady increase in SBP until 65 years of age and a decrease from 70 to 90 years. SBP in the no- dementia group increased until 80 years before it leveled off from 80 to 90 years. The present study confirms findings of higher midlife SBP and lower late-life SBP in people with dementia. This pattern may have several explanations and it highlights the need for close monitoring of BP treatment in older adults, with frequent reappraisal of treatment needs.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The complex pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to a limited therapeutic effect; therefore, the combination of multiple bioactive ingredients may be more effective in improving AD due to synergistic effects. Based on the perspective of the sea-land combination, the effects of sea-derived Antarctic krill oil (AKO) combined with land-derived nobiletin (Nob) and L-theanine (The) on memory loss and cognitive deficiency were studied in senescence-accelerated prone 8 mice (SAMP8). The results demonstrated that AKO combined with The significantly increased the number of platform crossings in the Morris water maze test by 1.6-fold, and AKO combined with Nob significantly increased the preference index in a novel object recognition test. AKO exhibited synergistic effects with Nob and The in ameliorating recognition memory and spatial memory deficiency in SAMP8 mice, respectively. Further research of the mechanism indicated that AKO exhibited synergistic effects with Nob in suppressing \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) aggregation, neurofibrillary tangles, and apoptosis and neuroinflammation, while the synergistic effects of AKO and The involved in synaptic plasticity and anti-neuroinflammation, which revealed that the combination was complex, not a mechanical addition. These findings revealed that the sea-land combination may be an effective strategy to treat and alleviate AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, Pin1, has a protective role in age-related neurodegeneration by targeting different phosphorylation sites of tau and the key proteins required to produce Amyloid-\u03b2, which are the well-known molecular signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The direct interaction of miR-140-5p with Pin1 mRNA and its inhibitory role in protein translation has been identified. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the role of miRNA-140-5p inhibition in promoting Pin1 expression and the therapeutic potential of the AntimiR-140-5p in the A\u00df oligomer (A\u00dfO)-induced AD rat model.Spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze. RT-PCR, western blot, and histological assays were performed on hippocampal samples at various time points after treatments. miRNA-140-5p inhibition enhanced Pin1 and ADAM10 mRNA expressions but has little effect on Pin1 protein level.The miRNA-140-5p inhibitor markedly ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficits induced by A\u00dfO, and concomitantly suppressed the mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and phosphorylation of tau at three key sites (thr231, ser396, and ser404) as well as increased phosphorylated Ser473-Akt.According to our results, Antimir-140-mediated improvement of A\u03b2O-induced neuronal injury and memory impairment in rats may provide an appropriate rationale for evaluating miR-140-5p inhibitors as a promising agent for the treatment of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The protracted preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides the opportunity for early intervention to prevent the disease; however, the lack of minimally invasive and easily detectable biomarkers and their measurement technologies remain unresolved. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized membrane vesicles released from a variety of cells and play important roles in cell-cell communication. Neuron-derived and ganglioside-enriched EVs capture amyloid-\u00df protein, a major AD agent, and transport it into glial cells for degradation; this suggests that EVs influence A\u00df accumulation in the brain. EV heterogeneity, however, requires the use of a highly sensitive technique for measuring specific EVs in biofluid. In this study, immuno-digital invasive cleavage assay (idICA) was developed for quantitating target-intact EVs.EVs were captured onto ganglioside GM1-specific cholera toxin B subunit (CTB)-conjugated magnetic beads and detected with a DNA oligonucleotide-labeled A\u00df antibody. Fluorescence signals for individual EVs were then counted using an invasive cleavage assay (ICA). This idICA examines the A\u00df-bound and GM1-containing EVs isolated from the culture supernatant of human APP-overexpressing N2a (APP-N2a) cells and APP transgenic\u00a0mice sera.The idICA quantitatively detected A\u00df-bound and GM1-containing EVs isolated from culture supernatants of APP-N2a cells and sera of AD model mice. The idICA levels of A\u00df-associated EVs in blood gradually increased from 3- to 12-month-old mice, corresponding to the progression of A\u00df accumulations in the brain of AD model mice.The present findings suggest that peripheral EVs harboring A\u00df and GM1 reflect A\u00df burden in mice. The idICA is a valuable tool for easy quantitative detection of EVs as an accessible biomarker for preclinical AD diagnosis.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "In 2021, aducanumab, an immunotherapy targeting amyloid-\u03b2, was approved for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the US Food and Drug Administration thanks to positive results on a putative biological surrogate marker. This approval has raised an unprecedented controversy. It was followed by a refusal of the European Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials. Compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, the common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid immunotherapies is their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients. Here, we review the available evidence regarding efficacy and safety data and medico-economical aspects for high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies. We also perform frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy and safety of the highest dose groups from the two aducanumab phase 3 trials and the donanemab and lecanemab phase 2 trials. When pooled together, the data from high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies trials confirm a statistically significant clinical effect of these drugs on cognitive decline after 18 months (difference in cognitive decline measured with CDR-SB after 18 months between the high dose immunotherapy groups vs. placebo\u00a0=\u00a0-0.24 points; P=0.04, frequentist random-effect model), with results on ADAS-Cog being the most statistically robust. However, this effect remains below the previously established minimal clinically relevant values. In parallel, the drugs significantly increased the occurrence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E: risk ratio=13.39; P<0.0001), ARIA-hemorrhage (risk ratio=2.78; P=0.0002), and symptomatic and serious ARIA (7/1321=0.53% in the high dose groups versus 0/1446 in the placebo groups; risk ratio=6.44; P=0.04). The risk/benefit ratio of high-clearance immunotherapies in early AD is so far questionable after 18 months. Identifying subgroups of better responders, the perspective of combination therapies, and a longer follow-up may help improve their clinical relevance. Finally, the preliminary evidence from medico-economical analyses seems to indicate that the current cost of aducanumab in the US is not in reasonable alignment with its clinical benefits.",

(Chinese: Caowu/), are a kind of important Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with great medicinal value. Statistics show that there are over 600 efficient TCM formulations comprising Aconitum medicinal materials. But high toxicity limits their clinical application. Clinically, the Aconitum medicinal materials must undergo a complex processing process that includes soaking, steaming, and boiling with pharmaceutical excipients, which makes highly toxic ester diterpenoid alkaloids are hydrolyzed to form less toxic aminoalcohol-diterpenoid alkaloids (ADAs).This review aims to summarize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological activities of low-toxicity ADAs, providing a reference for future ADAs research and drug development.Accessible literature on ADAs published between 1984 and 2022 were screened and obtained from available electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct and Google Scholar, followed by systematic analysis.ADAs are secondary products of plant metabolism, widely distributed in the Aconitum species and Delphinium species. The toxicity of ADAs as pharmacodynamic components of Aconitum medicinal materials is much lower than that of other diterpenoid alkaloids due to the absence of ester bonds. On the one hand, the pharmacokinetics of ADAs have received little attention compared to other toxic alkaloids. The research primarily focuses on aconine and mesaconine. According to existing studies, ADAs absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is primarily passive with a short Tmax. Simultaneously, efflux transporters have less impact on ADAs absorption than non-ADAs. After entering the body, ADAs are widely distributed in the heart, liver, lungs, and kidney, but less in the brain. Notably, aconine is not well metabolized by liver microsomes. Aconine and mesaconine are excreted in urine and feces, respectively. ADAs, on the other hand, have been shown to have a variety of pharmacological activities, including cardiac, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and regenerative effects via regulating multiple signaling pathways, including Nrf2/ARE, PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/Chop, ERK/CREB, NF-\u03baB, Bcl-2/Bax, and GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways.ADAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on heart disease, neurological disease, and other systemic diseases. Moreover, ADAs have low toxicity and a wide range of safe doses. All of these suggest that ADAs have great potential for drug development.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Increased oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and H2S donors such as sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) can reduce oxidative stress in preclinical studies, however clinical benefits of such treatments are rather ambiguous. This is partly due to poor stability and bioavailability of the H2S donors, requiring impractically large doses that are associated with dose-limiting toxicity. Herein, we identified a bioavailable 3-mercaptopyruvate prodrug, sulfanegen, which is able to pose as a sacrificial redox substrate for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), one of the H2S biosynthetic enzymes in the brain. Sulfanegen is able to mitigate toxicity emanating from oxidative insults and the A\u03b21-42 peptide by releasing H2S through the 3MST pathway. When administered to symptomatic transgenic mouse model of AD (APP/PS1; 7 and 12 months) and mice that were intracerebroventricularly administered with the A\u03b21-42 peptide, sulfanegen was able to reverse oxidative and neuroinflammatory consequences of AD pathology by restoring 3MST function. Quantitative neuropathological analyses confirmed significant disease modifying effect of the compound on amyloid plaque burden and brain inflammatory markers. More importantly, sulfanegen treatment attenuated progressive neurodegeneration in these mice, as evident from the restoration of TH+\u00a0neurons in the locus coeruleus. This study demonstrates a previously unknown concept that supplementation of 3MST function in the brain may be a viable approach for the management of AD. Finally, brought into the spotlight is the potential of sulfanegen as a promising AD therapeutic for future drug development efforts.",

Several clinical profiles are more likely to appear in SD than in early-life depression, but it remains unclear whether the pathophysiology is different. The prevalence of dementia increases with aging, and the underlying pathophysiological processes in the preclinical phase begin even before cognitive deficits or neurological signs appear. SD may be either a risk factor for developing dementia or a prodromal stage of dementia. The inconsistent findings regarding the association between SD and incident dementia may be attributable to the neuropathological heterogeneity underlying SD. Most studies have focused on patients with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) as an outcome, but several clinicopathological studies suggest that primary age-related tauopathy and argyrophilic grain disease may account for a proportion of cases clinically misdiagnosed as AD in the elderly population. Furthermore, most AD cases have additional neuropathologic changes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Here, we review the neuropathological findings linking SD to incident dementia, focusing on common age-related neuropathologies. In particular, the roles of disturbance of neural circuity, imbalance of monoaminergic systems, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and elevated neuroinflammatory status are discussed.

The objective is to investigate the clinical sex ratios (men/women) and their associations with clinical features among individuals with mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) in China.We conducted a multicenter cohort study, including 1038 individuals with probable MCI-LB, DLB, PD-MCI, or PDD diagnosis from 22 memory clinics in China from January 2018 to March 2022, and recorded their demographic and clinical data by reviewing medical records. Descriptive and regression analyses were used to calculate the sex ratio (men/women), and its associations with demographic and clinical data.In this study, men comprised 35.14% (men/women sex ratio\u2009=\u20090.54) for MCI-LB, 46.72% (men/women sex ratio\u2009=\u20090.88) for DLB, 63.56% (men/women sex ratio\u2009=\u20091.74) for PD-MCI, and 52.40% (men/women sex ratio\u2009=\u20091.10) for PDD. Sex ratios roughly increased with age. Men had more parkinsonism (p\u2009=\u20090.000) and less fluctuating cognition (p\u2009=\u20090.024) in MCI-LB, and those with PD-MCI had more RBD (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Women with PD-MCI had lower MMSE scores (\u03b2\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20091.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58, p\u2009=\u20090.04), more irritability (0.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.46, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and fluctuating cognition (-\u20093.41\u2009\u00b1\u20091.31, p\u2009=\u20090.01), and less parkinsonism (-\u20092.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.97, p\u2009=\u20090.03) than men after adjusting for demographic and cardiometabolic conditions.There were more women in DLB and MCI-LB, and more men in PD-MCI and PDD. The sex distribution, demographic, and clinical characteristics differed, which strengthened the independence and heterogeneity of the four diseases, and indicated sex-sensitive strategies for management of dementia necessary.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is emerging as a key pathogenic factor in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where increased microvascular endothelial permeability has been proposed to play an important role. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to increased brain microvascular permeability in AD are not fully understood. We studied brain endothelial permeability in female APPswe/PS1\u2206E9 (APP/PS1) mice which constitute a transgenic mouse model of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) amyloidosis and found that permeability increases with aging in the areas showing the greatest amyloid plaque deposition. We performed an unbiased bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of brain endothelial cells (BECs) in female APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We observed that upregulation of interferon signaling gene expression pathways in BECs was among the most prominent transcriptomic signatures in the brain endothelium. Immunofluorescence analysis of isolated BECs from female APP/PS1 mice demonstrated higher levels of the Type I interferon-stimulated gene IFIT2. Immunoblotting of APP/PS1 BECs showed downregulation of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin. Stimulation of human brain endothelial cells with interferon-\u03b2 decreased the levels of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin as well as tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin-5 and increased barrier leakiness. Depletion of the Type I interferon receptor in human brain endothelial cells prevented interferon-\u03b2-induced VE-cadherin downregulation and restored endothelial barrier integrity. Our study suggests that Type I interferon signaling contributes to brain endothelial dysfunction in AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Few studies suggest possible links between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease but they have been limited by small sample sizes, diagnostic and recall bias. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the bidirectional causal association between genetic liability to ADHD and ASD on Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we estimated the causal effects independently of educational attainment and IQ, through multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR). We employed genetic variants associated with ADHD (20,183 cases/35,191 controls), ASD (18,381 cases/27,969 controls), Alzheimer's disease (71,880 cases/383,378 controls), educational attainment (n\u2009=\u2009766,345) and IQ (n\u2009=\u2009269,867) using the largest GWAS of European ancestry. There was limited evidence to suggest a causal effect of genetic liability to ADHD (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.00, 95% CI: 0.98-1.02, P\u2009=\u20090.39) or ASD (OR\u2009=\u20090.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01, P\u2009=\u20090.70) on Alzheimer's disease.

Several evidences from AD mice confirmed that antidepressants could delaying cognitive decline. However, the conclusions varied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) based on patients. This meta-analysis summarizes the cognitive impact of SGAs on AD patients with different neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Results show there is no effect on cognition and depression between SGAs treatment and controls, and this remains in subgroups analyses of duration of medication (<12 weeks or \u226512 weeks), drug classes (SSRIs or non-SSRIs), combination with anti-dementia medication, various NPS, and degree of AD. The available evidence provides no support for the efficacy of SGAs for cognition and depression of AD patients.

Our aim was to characterize the sleep architecture, respiratory patterns, and neuropathologic findings in FI.Eleven consecutive FI patients (ten familial, one sporadic) were examined with video-polysomnography (vPSG) between 2002 and 2017. Wake/sleep stages and respiration were evaluated using a modified scoring system. Postmortem neuropathology was assessed in seven patients.Median age at onset was 48 years and survival after vPSG was 1 year. All patients had different combinations of breathing disturbances including increased respiratory rate variability (RRV; n\u00a0=\u00a07), stridor (n\u00a0=\u00a09), central sleep apnea (CSA) (n\u00a0=\u00a05), hiccup (n\u00a0=\u00a06), catathrenia (n\u00a0=\u00a07), and other expiratory sounds (n\u00a0=\u00a010). RRV in NREM sleep correlated with ambiguous and solitary nuclei degeneration (r\u00a0=\u00a00.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and reduced survival (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037). Two new stages, Subwake1 and Subwake2, present in all patients, were characterized. NREM sleep (conventional or undifferentiated) was identifiable in ten patients but reduced in duration in eight. REM sleep occurred in short segments in nine patients, and their reduced duration correlated with medullary raphe nuclei degeneration (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Seven patients had REM without atonia. Three vPSG patterns were identified: agitated, with aperiodic, manipulative, and finalistic movements (n\u00a0=\u00a04); quiet-apneic, with CSA (n\u00a0=\u00a04); and quiet-non-apneic (n\u00a0=\u00a03).FI patients show frequent breathing alterations, associated with respiratory nuclei damage, and, in addition to NREM sleep distortion, have severe impairment of REM sleep, related with raphe nuclei degeneration.

In our study, 660 \u03b2-amyloid-positive participants staged with preclinical AD, prodromal AD, and dementia due to AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were selected. Cognitive reserve and brain reserve were defined by conventional proxies or the residual method at baseline. We evaluated the utility of these reserves in predicting longitudinal cognitive change by mixed effects models and used a multi-state model to estimate stage duration stratified by reserve groups. Corrected for age, sex, and APOE-\u03b54 status, reserve was associated with cognitive decline, and the effects changed depending on the specific measures of reserve and the stage of AD. Reserves defined by the residual method were stronger predictors of cognitive change than those defined by conventional proxies. The estimated time from preclinical to mild AD dementia varied from 15-24\u00a0years based on the different reserve groups, and we observed a linear trend for the longest duration in individuals with high cognitive reserve/high brain reserve, followed by those with high cognitive reserve/low brain reserve, low cognitive reserve/high brain reserve, and low cognitive reserve/low brain reserve. This study showed a reduced risk of cognitive decline for individuals with higher level of reserve regardless of methods for measuring reserve. Interindividual differences in reserve may be important for clinical practice and trial design.",

Definitely diagnosed by autopsy, the clear mechanism of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis process needs to be illustrated. MicroRNAs are suggested to be involved in many diseases. We aimed to investigate the role of microRNA in Alzheimer's disease.We attempted to discover the role of microRNA in Alzheimer's disease by microarray bioinformatics analysis using autopsy sample data from the GEO database. Temporal cortex samples were included in this study. Bioinformatics analyses and visualization were processed based on R.After filtering out significantly differential expressed microRNAs and genes, enrichment analyses of both microRNAs and genes were conducted, respectively. Then, we constructed a transcription factor-microRNA-mRNA network and a protein-protein interaction network. In parallel, we used the receiver operating characteristic curve to evaluate the diagnostic value of microRNA. Based on the evidence, we finally identified hsa-miR-365b-5p as a key target in Alzheimer's disease.Hsa-miR-365b-5p act as a key target in Alzheimer's disease.

We examined whether published AD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes were associated with ICH utilizing genome-wide association study data from 2 independent studies (genetic and environmental risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke [GERFHS] study and genetics of cerebral hemorrhage with anticoagulation [GOCHA]). Analyses included evaluation by location of ICH. GERFHS and GOCHA cohorts contained 745 ICH cases and 536 controls for analysis.

Using baseline and follow-up assessments four groups were defined: Older adults who were healthy (HOA), with very mild cognitive but not functional impairment (eMCI), and with MCI who did and did not convert to dementia (MCI converters and non-converters).Only the VSTMBT predicted group membership in the very early stages (HOA vs eMCI). As the disease progressed, the FCSRT became a strong predictor excluding the VSTMB from the models. Their complementary value was high during the mid-prodromal stages and decreased in stages closer to dementia.The study supports the notion that neuropsychological assessment for AD needs to abandon the notion of one-size-fits-all.

We previously documented that Treg immunomodulatory mechanisms are compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ex vivo expansion of Tregs restores and amplifies their immunosuppressive functions in vitro. A key question is whether adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded human Tregs can suppress neuroinflammation and amyloid pathology in a preclinical mouse model.An immunodeficient mouse model of AD was generated by backcrossing the 5xFAD onto Rag2 knockout mice (5xFAD-Rag2KO). Human Tregs were expanded ex vivo for 24\u00a0days and administered to 5xFAD-Rag2KO. Changes in amyloid burden, microglia characteristics and reactive astrocytes were evaluated using ELISA and confocal microscopy. NanoString Mouse AD multiplex gene expression analysis was applied to explore the impact of ex vivo expanded Tregs on the neuroinflammation transcriptome.Elimination of mature B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice was associated with upregulation of 95 inflammation genes and amplified number of reactive microglia within the dentate gyrus. Administration of ex vivo expanded Tregs reduced amyloid burden and reactive glial cells in the dentate gyrus and frontal cortex of 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice. Interrogation of inflammation gene expression documented down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A&B, IL6), complement cascade (C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, C4a/b), toll-like receptors (Tlr3, Tlr4 and Tlr7) and microglial activations markers (CD14, Tyrobp,Trem2) following Treg administration.Ex vivo expanded Tregs with amplified immunomodulatory function, suppressed neuroinflammation and alleviated AD pathology in vivo.

At the age of 12 months, behavioral tests were completed for all groups. After completing behavioral testing, their brains were assessed for amyloid pathology, microgliosis, and cholinergic cells.The results showed that APPNL-G-F mice allowed to voluntarily exercise showed an improvement in cognitive functions. Furthermore, long-term exercise also improved anxiety in APPNL-G-F mice as assessed by measuring thigmotaxis in the Morris water task. We also found reductions in amyloid load and microgliosis, and a preservation of cholinergic cells in the brain of APPNL-G-F mice allowed to exercise in their home cages. These profound reductions in brain pathology associated with AD are likely responsible for the observed improvement of learning and memory functions following extensive and regular exercise.These findings suggest the potential of physical exercise to mitigate the cognitive deficits in AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Both cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and hypertensive arteriopathy (HA) are related to cognitive impairment and dementia. This study aimed to clarify CAA- and HA-related small vessel disease (SVD) imaging marker associations with cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer disease (AD) subtypes.A sample of 137 subjects with clinically diagnosed late-onset AD identified from the dementia registry of a single center from January 2017 to October 2021 were enrolled. Semi-quantitative imaging changes (visual rating scale grading) suggestive of SVD were analyzed singularly and compositely, and their correlations with cognitive domains and AD subtypes were examined.Patients with typical and limbic-predominant AD subtypes had worse cognitive performance and higher dementia severity than minimal-atrophy subtype patients. Deep white matter hyperintensity (WMH) presence correlated inversely with short-term memory (STM) performance. The three composite SVD scores correlated with different cognitive domains and had distinct associations with AD subtypes. After adjusting for relevant demographic factors, multivariate logistic regression (using minimal-atrophy subtype as the reference condition) revealed the following: associations of the typical subtype with periventricular WMH [odds ratio (OR) 2.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-5.57, p\u2009=\u20090.012], global SVD score (OR 1.67; 95%CI, 1.11-2.52, p\u2009=\u20090.009), and HA-SVD score (OR 1.93; 95%CI, 1.10-3.52, p\u2009=\u20090.034); associations of limbic-predominant subtype with HA-SVD score (OR 2.57; 95%CI, 1.23-5.37, p\u2009=\u20090.012) and most global and domain-specific cognitive scores; and an association of hippocampal-sparing subtype with HA-SVD score (OR 3.30; 95%CI, 1.58-6.85, p\u2009=\u20090.001).Composite SVD imaging markers reflect overall CAA and/or HA severity and may have differential associations with cognitive domains and AD subtypes. Our finding supports the possibility that the clinical AD subtypes may reflect differing burdens of underlying CAA and HA microangiopathologies.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "To date, there are no effective treatments for most neurodegenerative diseases. Knowledge graphs can provide comprehensive and semantic representation for heterogeneous data, and have been successfully leveraged in many biomedical applications including drug repurposing. Our objective is to construct a knowledge graph from literature to study the relations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chemicals, drugs and dietary supplements in order to identify opportunities to prevent or delay neurodegenerative progression. We collected biomedical annotations and extracted their relations using SemRep via SemMedDB. We used both a BERT-based classifier and rule-based methods during data preprocessing to exclude noise while preserving most AD-related semantic triples. The 1,672,110 filtered triples were used to train with knowledge graph completion algorithms (i.e., TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx) to predict candidates that might be helpful for AD treatment or prevention.Among three knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed the other two (MR = 10.53, Hits@1 = 0.28). We leveraged the time-slicing technique to further evaluate the prediction results. We found supporting evidence for most highly ranked candidates predicted by our model which indicates that our approach can inform reliable new knowledge.This paper shows that our graph mining model can predict reliable new relationships between AD and other entities (i.e., dietary supplements, chemicals, and drugs). The knowledge graph constructed can facilitate data-driven knowledge discoveries and the generation of novel hypotheses.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "With the exception of a few monogenic forms, Alzheimer disease (AD) has a complex aetiology that is likely to involve multiple susceptibility genes and environmental factors. The role of environmental factors is difficult to determine and, until a few years ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying gene-environment (G\u2009\u00d7\u2009E) interactions in AD were largely unknown. Here, we review evidence that has emerged over the past two decades to explain how environmental factors, such as diet, lifestyle, alcohol, smoking and pollutants, might interact with the human genome. In particular, we discuss how various environmental AD risk factors can induce epigenetic modifications of key AD-related genes and pathways and consider how epigenetic mechanisms could contribute to the effects of oxidative stress on AD onset. Studies on early-life exposures are helping to uncover critical time windows of sensitivity to epigenetic influences from environmental factors, thereby laying the foundations for future primary preventative approaches. We conclude that epigenetic modifications need to be considered when assessing G\u2009\u00d7\u2009E interactions in AD.",

The 21st Century Cures Act in the U.S. now requires patient access to many components of the electronic health record (EHR). While these changes promise to enhance communication and information sharing, they also bring higher risks of unwanted disclosure, both within and outside of health systems. Having preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD), where biological markers of AD are identified before the onset of any symptoms, is sensitive PHI. Because of the melding of ideas between preclinical and \"clinical\" (symptomatic) AD, unwanted disclosure of preclinical AD status can lead to personal harms of stigma, discrimination, and changes to insurability. At present, preclinical AD is identified mainly in research settings, though consensus criteria for a clinical diagnosis may soon be established. There is not yet adequate legal protection for the growing number of individuals with preclinical AD. Some PHI generated in preclinical AD trials has clinical significance, necessitating urgent evaluations and longitudinal monitoring in care settings. AD researchers are obligated to both respect the confidentiality of participants' sensitive PHI and facilitate providers' access to necessary information, often requiring disclosure of preclinical AD status. The AD research community must continue to develop ethical, participant-centered practices related to confidentiality and disclosure, with attention to sensitive information in the EHR. These practices will be essential for translation into the clinic, and across health systems and society at large.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The past three decades have seen multiple reports of people with neurodegenerative disorders, or other forms of changes in their brains, who also show putative changes in how they approach and produce visual art. Authors argue that these cases may provide a unique body of evidence, so-called 'artistic signatures' of neurodegenerative diseases, that might be used to understand disorders, provide diagnoses, be employed in treatment, create patterns of testable hypotheses for causative study, and also provide unique insight into the neurobiological linkages between the mind, brain, body, and the human penchant for art-making itself. However-before we can begin to meaningfully build from such emerging findings, much less formulate applications-not only is such evidence currently quite disparate and in need of systematic review, almost all case reports and artwork ratings are entirely subjective, based on authors' personal observations or a sparse collection of methods that may not best fit underlying research aims. This leads to the very real question of whether we might actually find patterns of systematic change if fit to a rigorous review-Can we really 'read' art to illuminate possible changes in the brain? How might we best approach this topic in future neuroscientific, clinical, and art-related research? This paper presents a review of this field and answer to these questions. We consider the current case reports for seven main disorders-Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia, corticobasal degeneration, aphasia, as well as stroke-consolidating arguments for factors and changes related to art-making and critiquing past methods. Taking the published artworks from these papers, we then conduct our own assessment, employing computerized and human-rater-based approaches, which we argue represent best practice to identify stylistic or creativity/quality changes. We suggest, indeed, some evidence for systematic patterns in art-making for specific disorders and also find that case authors showed rather high agreement with our own assessments. More important, through opening this topic and past evidence to a systematic review, we hope to open a discussion and provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for future application and research on the intersection of art-making and the neurotypical, the changed, and the artistic brain.",

Microvesicles (MVs) participate in neuronal cells' cross-talk in physiological and pathological states. Microvesicles released in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may provide a valuable footprint of brain changes. Little information is available regarding the release of fractalkine-positive MVs (CX3CL1+ -MVs) in the nervous system.We induced cognitive impairment by bilateral injection of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) into the cerebral ventricles. We analyzed the CSF by flow cytometry in two experiments (trained and untrained) to elucidate the presence of CX3CL1+ -MVs. The hippocampal TNF-\u03b1 as an inflammatory factor was assessed by immunohistochemistry.The A\u03b2 induced spatial memory impairment after two weeks, verified by a decrease in the escape latency in Morris water maze test. It caused an increase in the anxiety-like behaviors demonstrated by a decrease in entries into the open arms of elevated plus maze test. The A\u03b2 increased the percent of the positive area for TNF-\u03b1 staining. Histological evaluation of the hippocampus confirmed the tissue injuries. The CSF levels of CX3CL1+ -MVs, increased 2 and 7\u00a0days after A\u03b2 injection. The A\u03b2 increased the TNF-\u03b1 staining and provided an inflammatory context to facilitate the MVs release. The rise of CX3CL1+ -MVs was transient and subsided after two weeks. Both trained and untrained experiments showed a similar rise pattern of CX3CL1+ -MVs.Increase of fractalkine-positive microvesicles preceded the cognitive impairment, more studies are required to approve the CX3CL1+ -MVs as a potential biomarker in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",

Recent advances in the automated analysis of speech show promising results in the identification of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its purported pre-clinical stage. We utilized automated methods to analyze speech recorded over the telephone in 91 community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with mild AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or cognitively healthy. We asked whether natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning could more accurately identify groups than traditional screening tools and be sensitive to subtle differences in speech between the groups. Despite variable recording quality, NLP methods differentiated the three groups with greater accuracy than two traditional dementia screeners and a clinician who read transcripts of their speech. Imperfect speech data collected via a telephone is of sufficient quality to be examined with the latest speech technologies. Critically, these data reveal significant differences in speech that closely match the clinical diagnoses of AD, aMCI and healthy control.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Intrinsically disordered peptides, such as amyloid \u03b242 (A\u03b242), lack a well-defined structure in solution. A\u03b242 can undergo abnormal aggregation and amyloidogenesis in the brain, forming fibrillar plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The insoluble fibrillar forms of A\u03b242 exhibit well-defined, cross \u03b2-sheet structures at the molecular level and are less toxic than the soluble, intermediate disordered oligomeric forms. However, the mechanism of initial interaction of monomers and subsequent oligomerization is not well understood. The structural disorder of A\u03b242 adds to the challenges of determining the structural properties of its monomers, making it difficult to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenic aggregation. Certain regions of A\u03b242 are known to exhibit helical propensity in different physiological conditions. NMR spectroscopy has shown that the A\u03b242 monomer at lower pH can adopt an \u03b1-helical conformation and as the pH is increased, the peptide switches to \u03b2-sheet conformation and aggregation occurs. CD spectroscopy studies of aggregation have shown the presence of an initial spike in the amount of \u03b1-helical content at the start of aggregation. Such an increase in \u03b1-helical content suggests a mechanism wherein the peptide can expose critical non-polar residues for interaction, leading to hydrophobic aggregation with other interacting peptides. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize in detail the conformational landscape of monomeric A\u03b242 in solution to identify molecular properties that may mediate the early stages of oligomerization. We hypothesized that conformations with \u03b1-helical structure have a higher probability of initiating aggregation because they increase the hydrophobicity of the peptide. Although random coil conformations were found to be the most dominant, as expected, \u03b1-helical conformations are thermodynamically accessible, more so than \u03b2-sheet conformations. Importantly, for the first time \u03b1-helical conformations are observed to increase the exposure of aromatic and hydrophobic residues to the aqueous solvent, favoring their hydrophobically driven interaction with other monomers to initiate aggregation. These findings constitute a first step toward characterizing the mechanism of formation of disordered, low-order oligomers of A\u03b242.",

Institute of Cancer Research mice injected with beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) (1-42) (i.c.v.) and APP/PS1 transgenic (TG) mice were orally administered with HJW at 500\u2009mg/kg/day for 3 weeks.

Recent advances in digital technology and natural language processing methods make this test a candidate for automated administration and scoring. Multiple parallel test stimuli are required for higher-frequency disease monitoring.This study aims to develop and validate a remote and fully automated story recall task, suitable for longitudinal assessment, in a population of older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD.The \"Amyloid Prediction in Early Stage Alzheimer's disease\" (AMYPRED) studies recruited participants in the United Kingdom (AMYPRED-UK: NCT04828122) and the United States (AMYPRED-US: NCT04928976). Participants were asked to complete optional daily self-administered assessments remotely on their smart devices over 7 to 8 days. Assessments included immediate and delayed recall of 3 stories from the Automatic Story Recall Task (ASRT), a test with multiple parallel stimuli (18 short stories and 18 long stories) balanced for key linguistic and discourse metrics. Verbal responses were recorded and securely transferred from participants' personal devices and automatically transcribed and scored using text similarity metrics between the source text and retelling to derive a generalized match score. Group differences in adherence and task performance were examined using logistic and linear mixed models, respectively. Correlational analysis examined parallel-forms reliability of ASRTs and convergent validity with cognitive tests (Logical Memory Test and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite with semantic processing). Acceptability and usability data were obtained using a remotely administered questionnaire.Of the 200 participants recruited in the AMYPRED studies, 151 (75.5%)-78 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 73 MCI or mild AD-engaged in optional remote assessments. Adherence to daily assessment was moderate and did not decline over time but was higher in CU participants (ASRTs were completed each day by 73/106, 68.9% participants with MCI or mild AD and 78/94, 83% CU participants). Participants reported favorable task usability: infrequent technical problems, easy use of the app, and a broad interest in the tasks. Task performance improved modestly across the week and was better for immediate recall. The generalized match scores were lower in participants with MCI or mild AD (Cohen d=1.54). Parallel-forms reliability of ASRT stories was moderate to strong for immediate recall (mean rho 0.73, range 0.56-0.88) and delayed recall (mean rho=0.73, range=0.54-0.86). The ASRTs showed moderate convergent validity with established cognitive tests.The unsupervised, self-administered ASRT task is sensitive to cognitive impairments in MCI and mild AD. The task showed good usability, high parallel-forms reliability, and high convergent validity with established cognitive tests.

In the first case, the toxic effect of mercury and arsenic on the brain stimulates oxidative stress, which leads to the formation of free oxygen species and a decrease in the antioxidant defense of neurons. In the second case, the harmful effect of mercury changes the structure and properties of \u03b2-amyloid, and the toxic effect of arsenic contributes to its accumulation. In the pathogenesis of the diseases under consideration, particular importance is attached to the reaction of astrocytes that initiate neuroinflammation, which is also characteristic of mercury and arsenic intoxication. Considering that the symptoms recorded during intoxication with mercury and arsenic are in many respects similar to those of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and their pathogenetic mechanisms (oxidative stress and neuroinflammation) coincide, then the toxic effects of mercury and arsenic in neurodegenerative diseases analyzed in this review can be characterized as the influence of the most

Five-year risk of AD dementia was modeled using survival analysis.A demographic model was developed and validated on independent data with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 5-year prediction of AD dementia of 0.79. Clinical and cognitive variables (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.79), and apolipoprotein E genotype (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.76) were added to the demographic model. We then incorporated the risk computed from the demographic model with hazard ratios computed from independent data for amyloid positron emission tomography status and magnetic resonance imaging hippocampal volume (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.84), and for plasma amyloid beta (A\u03b2)42/A\u03b240 (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.82).An adaptive tool was developed and validated to compute absolute risks of AD dementia. This approach allows for improved accuracy and communication of AD risk among cognitively unimpaired older adults.",

Associations between biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin-10 [IL-10], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1],, and C-reactive protein [CRP]) and self-reported sleep or cognition measures, were assessed.Average sleep duration was significantly lower for AA versus whites (average[SD]) in hours: 6.02(1.18) versus 7.23(0.91), P = .000004). We found a statistically significant association between plasma IL-10 and sleep duration (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.26, P = .04) and CSF ICAM-1 and sleep quality (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.30, P = .03).Longer sleep duration is positively associated with plasma IL-10 levels irrespective of race. Sleep quality was positively associated with CSF ICAM-1 only in African Americans.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Sleep and diet are modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that may be salient areas for the development of preventive intervention strategies against dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sleep disturbances account for up to 15% of the population attributable risk for AD. Diet influences sleep quality, such that diets high in sugars, fat, and processed food affect sleep quality and cognition in older adults. The combination of poor sleep and diet health may increase risk for dementia in people with MCI, yet it is unknown how intervening on diet may influence sleep health.The MCI Sleep Study assesses longitudinal changes in objective and subjective measures of sleep between two investigational diet groups in the Brain Energy for Amyloid Transformation in Alzheimer's Disease study: the modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet. Objective sleep assessments include an in-home sleep study using the WatchPAT Central Plus (Itamar Medical, Ltd) at baseline and the end of the 4-month diet intervention. Subjective sleep questionnaires include the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The MCI Sleep Study outcome measures include longitudinal change in cognitive performance, mood, behavior, and quality of life.Study recruitment is currently ongoing. We hypothesize the low-carb MMKD diet to have a beneficial impact on sleep health in individuals with MCI. Pre- and post-diet changes in sleep metrics across diet groups will be examined using mixed effects analysis of variance models.Early assessment of chronic sleep and diet behaviors may be vital in understanding when interventions are necessary and the lifestyle modifications that should accompany future AD prevention and therapy recommendations.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias allows clinicians and patients to prepare for future needs and identify treatment options. Medicare's Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) requires detection of cognitive impairment and may increase dementia diagnosis. We estimated the relationship between AWV receipt and incident dementia.Using a retrospective cohort of Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) beneficiaries enrolled for at least 3 years from 2009 to 2016 and two-stage least squares, we quantified the relationship between AWV and incident diagnosis of cognitive impairment/dementia, and by race/ethnicity. The county-level change in percent of beneficiaries receiving AWVs was used as an instrumental variable to account for unobserved factors associated with individuals' AWV receipt and diagnosis. Sample included 3,333,617 beneficiaries ages 67 years and older, without dementia at the beginning of the study.Beneficiaries included 2,713,573 White, 251,958 Black, 196,845 Hispanic, 95,719 Asian, 11,727 American Indian/Alaska Native, and 63,795 of other race/ethnicity. Using ordinary least squares, dementia incidence was -0.79 percentage points (95% CI -0.81 to -0.76) lower for persons receiving an AWV compared to no AWV. Using instrumental variables reversed the direction of the effect: AWV receipt increased dementia diagnoses by 0.47 percentage points (95% CI 0.14 to 0.80), 15% over baseline. AWVs increased diagnoses 2.0 percentage points (95% CI 0.05 to 3.94) among Blacks, 0.40 percentage points (95% CI 0.05 to 0.75) among Whites, but est were imprecise for Hispanics and Asians.Increasing AWV take-up and supporting physicians' performance of cognitive assessment may further improve dementia detection in the population and among groups at higher risk of undiagnosed dementia.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "It is valuable to identify common latent cognitive constructs for dementia prevalence estimation across Chinese aging cohorts.Based on cognitive measures of 12015 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS; 13 items) and 6623 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; 9 items) participants aged 65 to 99 in 2018, confirmatory factor analysis was applied to identify latent cognitive constructs, and to estimate dementia prevalence compared to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and nationwide estimates of the literature.A common three-factor cognitive construct of orientation, memory, and executive function and language was found for both cohorts with adequate model fits. Crude dementia prevalence estimated by factor scores was similar to MMSE in CLHLS, and was more reliable in CHARLS. Age-standardized dementia estimates of CLHLS were lower than CHARLS among those aged 70+, which were close to the nationwide prevalence reported by the COAST study and Global Burden of Disease.We verified common three-factor cognitive constructs for both cohorts, providing an approach to estimate dementia prevalence at the national level.Common three-factor cognitive constructs were identified in Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).Crude dementia estimates using factor scores were reliable in both cohorts.Estimates of CHARLS were close to current evidence, but higher than that of CLHLS.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related neurodegenerative disease. The main pathological features of AD are \u03b2-amyloid protein (A\u03b2) deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Currently, there are no effective drugs for the etiological treatment of AD. Rifampicin (RIF) is a semi-synthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic with anti-\u03b2-amyloid deposition, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, and neuroprotective effects, but its application in AD treatment has been limited for its strong hydrophobicity, high toxicity, short half-life, low bioavailability, and blood-brain barrier hindrance. We designed a novel brain-targeted and MRI-characteristic nanomedicine via loading rabies virus protein 29 (RVG29), rifampicin, and Gd on poly (l-lactide) nanoparticles (RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29). The cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 had favorable biocompatibility and security. Fluorescence imaging in vivo showed that PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 could deliver rifampicin into the brain by enhancing cellular uptake and brain targeting performance, leading to improvement of the bioavailability of rifampicin. In in vivo study, RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 improved the spatial learning and memory capability of APP/PS1 mice in the Morris water maze, as compared to rifampicin. Immunofluorescence, TEM, immunoblotting, and H&E staining revealed that RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 reduced A\u03b2 deposition in hippocampal and cortex of APP/PS1 mice, improved the damage of synaptic ultrastructure, increased the expression level of PSD95 and SYP, as well as reduced the necrosis of neurons. These findings suggest that RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 may be an effective strategy for the treatment of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "In Alzheimer's Diseases (AD) research, multimodal imaging analysis can unveil complementary information from multiple imaging modalities and further our understanding of the disease. One application is to discover disease subtypes using unsupervised clustering. However, existing clustering methods are often applied to input features directly, and could suffer from the curse of dimensionality with high-dimensional multimodal data. The purpose of our study is to identify multimodal imaging-driven subtypes in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) participants using a multiview learning framework based on Deep Generalized Canonical\u00a0Correlation\u00a0Analysis (DGCCA), to learn shared latent representation with low dimensions from 3 neuroimaging modalities.DGCCA applies non-linear transformation to input views using neural networks and is able to learn correlated\u00a0embeddings with low dimensions that capture more variance than its linear counterpart, generalized CCA (GCCA). We designed experiments to compare DGCCA embeddings with single modality features and GCCA embeddings by generating 2 subtypes from each feature set using unsupervised clustering. In our validation studies, we found that amyloid PET imaging has the most discriminative features compared with structural MRI and FDG PET which DGCCA learns from but not GCCA. DGCCA subtypes show differential measures in 5 cognitive assessments, 6 brain volume measures, and conversion to AD patterns. In addition, DGCCA MCI subtypes confirmed AD genetic markers with strong signals that existing late MCI group did not identify.Overall, DGCCA is able to learn effective low dimensional embeddings from multimodal data by learning non-linear projections. MCI subtypes generated from DGCCA embeddings are different from existing early and late MCI groups and show most similarity with those identified by amyloid PET features. In our validation studies, DGCCA subtypes show distinct patterns in cognitive measures, brain volumes, and are able to identify AD genetic markers. These findings indicate the promise of the imaging-driven subtypes and their power in revealing disease structures beyond early and late stage MCI.",

However, their clinical significance remains poorly understood. We carried out a multimodal approach to evaluate the impact of CMBs at a clinical, neuropsychological, and survival level, as well as on core AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in AD patients.We prospectively recruited 98 patients with mild-moderate AD. At baseline, they underwent brain MRI, and AD CSF biomarkers and APOE genotypes were analysed. An extensive neuropsychological battery was performed at baseline and after 1\u2009year of follow-up. We analysed the stroke incidence and mortality with survival analyses.Forty-eight (48.5%) patients had at least one CMBs. Eight (8.2%) patients had strictly nonlobar CMBs, 39 (40.2%) had any lobar CMB locations. The incidence of stroke was higher in AD patients with lobar CMBs than in those without CMBs (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Mortality did not differ among groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05). At the cognitive level, CMBs patients deteriorated more rapidly at 12\u2009months according to MMSE scores, with no differences observed at 24\u2009months. We did not observe differences in the other tests, except for an increase in caregiver burden in the CMBs group. The presence of cerebral amyloidosis and APOE \u03b54 were associated with a greater presence of CMBs.CMBs are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in AD patients without differences in mortality. Patients with CMBs did not seem to have different consequences associated with cognitive decline except for an increase in caregiver overload.",

Increasing evidence indicates that periodontal pathogens and subsequent inflammatory responses to them contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The intestine and central nervous system jointly engage in crosstalk; microbiota-mediated immunity significantly impacts AD via the gut-brain axis. However, the exact mechanism linking periodontitis to AD remains unclear. In this study, we explored the influence of periodontitis-related salivary microbiota on AD based on the gut-brain crosstalk in APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 (PAP) transgenic mice. Saliva samples were collected from patients with periodontitis and healthy individuals. The salivary microbiota was gavaged into PAP mice for two months. Continuous gavage of periodontitis-related salivary microbiota in PAP mice impaired cognitive function and increased \u03b2-amyloid accumulation and neuroinflammation. Moreover, these AD-related pathologies were consistent with gut microbial dysbiosis, intestinal pro-inflammatory responses, intestinal barrier impairment, and subsequent exacerbation of systemic inflammation, suggesting that the periodontitis-related salivary microbiota may aggravate AD pathogenesis through crosstalk of the gut-brain axis. In this study, we demonstrated that periodontitis might participate in the pathogenesis of AD by swallowing salivary microbiota, verifying the role of periodontitis in AD progression and providing a novel perspective on the etiology and intervention strategies of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Introduction: In vivo characterization of pathologic deposition of tau protein in the human brain by PET imaging is a promising tool in drug development trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 18-F MK- 6240 is a radiotracer with high selectivity and sub-nanomolar affinity for neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that shows favorable non-specific brain penetration and excellent kinetic properties. The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a visual assessment method that provides both an overall assessment of brain tauopathy and regional characterization of abnormal tau deposition. Methods: 18-F MK-6240 scans from 102 participants (including healthy volunteers, patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders) were reviewed by an expert nuclear medicine physician blind to participants' diagnosis to identify common patterns of brain uptake. This initial visual read method was field tested in a separate, non-overlapping cohort of 102 participants with 2 additional na\u00efve readers trained on the method. Visual read outcomes were compared with semiquantitative assessments using volume of interest (VOI) SUVr. Results: For the visual read eight gray-matter regions per hemisphere were assessed as negative (no abnormal uptake) or positive (1-25% of the region involved, 25-75% involvement, or >75% involvement), then characterized the tau binding pattern as positive or negative for evidence of tau, and if positive, whether brain uptake is in an AD pattern. Readers demonstrated agreement 94% of the time for overall positivity/negativity. Concordance on the determination of the regional binary outcomes (negative or positive) showed agreement of 74.3 % and Fleiss' k of 0.912. Using clinical diagnosis as the ground truth, readers demonstrated a sensitivity of 73-79% and specificity of 91-93, with combined reader concordance sensitivity of 80% and specificity 93%. Cortical regions average SUVr showed a robust correlation with visually-derived ratings of regional involvement (r = .73, P < .0001). Conclusion: We developed a visual read algorithm for 18-F MK-6240 PET offering both determination of scan positivity and the regional degree of cortical involvement. These cross-sectional results show strong inter-reader concordance on both binary and regional assessments of tau deposition, as well as good sensitivity and excellent specificity supporting use as a tool for clinical trials.",

All images were analyzed with DB, NQ, and FS software to obtain volume estimates and N% of various segmented brain regions. We used Bland-Altman analysis, repeated measures ANOVA, reproducibility coefficient, effect size, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to evaluate inter-method agreement and reliability.Among the three software programs, the Bland-Altman plot showed a substantial bias, the ICC showed a broad range of reliability (0.004-0.97), and repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant mean volume differences in all brain regions. Similarly, the volume differences of the three software programs had large effect sizes in most regions (0.73-5.51). The effect size was largest in the pallidum in both datasets and smallest in the thalamus and cerebral white matter in the SMC and ADNI datasets, respectively. N% of NQ and DB showed an unacceptably broad Bland-Altman limit of agreement in all brain regions and a very wide range of ICC values (-0.142-0.844) in most brain regions.NQ and DB showed significant differences in the measured volume and N%, with limited agreement and reliability for most brain regions.

Two-month-old ICR mice were treated with SP or normal saline for 21\u00a0days (control group, A\u03b21-42 group, A\u03b21-42\u00a0+\u00a0SP50 mg/kg group, A\u03b21-42\u00a0+\u00a0SP100 mg/kg group, and A\u03b21-42\u00a0+\u00a0SP200 mg/kg group). Behavioral tests showed that SP alleviated cognitive and memory impairments in AD mice. Moreover, SP treatment significantly suppressed the level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the hippocampus. Concomitantly, the overexpression of interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the hippocampus induced by A\u03b21-42 was significantly reduced following treatment with SP. In addition, SP was able to increase the levels of synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic dense protein 95 (PSD95). Our study shows that SP could significantly improve A\u03b21-42-induced spatial learning and memory impairment by reducing neuroinflammation via inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and iNOS activation and restoring synapse plasticity by increasing synaptically associated protein levels, suggesting that SP has a positive effect and potential for AD therapies.",

Seventeen patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD (ADD); 23 patients with MCI due to AD, and 18 cognitively healthy controls (HC) were examined using Dynamic Retinal Vessel Analyzer. Oscillatory temporal changes of retinal vessel diameters were evaluated using mathematical signal analysis. Especially at moderately low frequencies around 0.1 Hz, arterial oscillations in ADD and MCI significantly prevailed over HC oscillations and correlated with disease severity. The pronounced retinal arterial vasomotion at moderately low frequencies in the ADD and MCI groups would be compatible with the view of a compensatory upregulation of paravascular drainage in AD and strengthen the amyloid clearance hypothesis.",

Here, we combine experiments with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent to explore the effects of neuronal ganglioside GM1, abundant in mammalian brains, on the aggregation of two principal isoforms of A\u03b2, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. Our simulations show that free GM1 forms stable, highly water-soluble complexes with both isoforms, and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments support the formation of well-ordered, structurally compact GM1+A\u03b2 complexes. By simulation, we also show that A\u03b240 monomers display a preference for binding to GM1-containing hetero-oligomers over GM1-lacking homo-oligomers, while A\u03b242 monomers have the opposite preference. These observations explain why GM1 dose-dependently inhibits A\u03b240 aggregation but has no effect on A\u03b242 aggregation, as assessed by thioflavin T fluorescence.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). Structural polymorphism observed among A\u03b2 fibrils in AD brains seem to correlate with the clinical subtypes suggesting a link between fibril polymorphism and pathology. Since fibrils emerge from a templated growth of low-molecular-weight oligomers, understanding the factors affecting oligomer generation is important. Membrane lipids are key factors to influence early stages of A\u03b2 aggregation and oligomer generation, which cause membrane disruption. We have previously demonstrated that conformationally discrete A\u03b2 oligomers can be generated by modulating the charge, composition, and chain length of lipids and surfactants. Here, we extend our studies into liposomal models by investigating A\u03b2 oligomerization on large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of total brain extracts (TBE), reconstituted lipid rafts (LRs), or 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). Varying the vesicle composition by specifically increasing the amount of GM1 gangliosides as a constituent, we found that only GM1-enriched liposomes induce the formation of toxic, low-molecular-weight oligomers. Furthermore, we found that the aggregation on liposome surface and membrane disruption are highly cooperative and sensitive to membrane surface characteristics. Numerical simulations confirm such a cooperativity and reveal that GM1-enriched liposomes form twice as many pores as those formed in the absence GM1. Overall, this study uncovers mechanisms of cooperativity between oligomerization and membrane disruption under controlled lipid compositional bias, and refocuses the significance of the early stages of A\u03b2 aggregation in polymorphism, propagation, and toxicity in AD.",

Few culturally tailored mobile health (mHealth) programs were designed for these vulnerable populations.This study reports the development of a culturally tailored mHealth program called Wellness Enhancement for Caregivers (WECARE) to improve caregiving skills, reduce distress, and improve the psychosocial well-being of Chinese American family caregivers of persons with dementia.Community-based user-centered design principles were applied in the program development. First, the structure and curriculum of the WECARE program were crafted based on existing evidence-based interventions for caregivers with input from 4 experts. Second, through working closely with 8 stakeholders, we culturally adapted evidence-based programs into multimedia program components. Lastly, 5 target users tested the initial WECARE program; their experience and feedback were used to further refine the program.The resulting WECARE is a 7-week mHealth program delivered via WeChat, a social media app highly popular in Chinese Americans. By subscribing to the official WECARE account, users can receive 6 interactive multimedia articles pushed to their WeChat accounts each week for 7 weeks. The 7 major themes include (1) facts of dementia and caregiving; (2) the enhancement of caregiving skills; (3) effective communication with health care providers, care partners, and family members; (4) problem-solving skills for caregiving stress management; (5) stress reduction and depression prevention; (6) the practice of self-care and health behaviors; and (7) social support and available resources. Users also have the option of joining group chats for peer support. The WECARE program also includes a back-end database that manages intervention delivery and tracks user engagement.The WECARE program represents one of the first culturally tailored social media-based interventions for Chinese American caregivers of persons with dementia. It demonstrates the use of community-based user-centered design principles in developing an mHealth intervention program in underserved communities. We call for more cultural adaptation and development of mHealth interventions for immigrant and racial/ethnic minority caregivers of persons with dementia.",

It is characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss and accounts for most cases of dementia in older people. AD can be rooted in genetic, epigenetic, or environmental causes. There are no drugs or other therapeutic agents to prevent or delay AD progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short and uncoded RNAs that can bind to 200 RNAs approximately. By inhibiting or destroying specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), they control gene expression and broadly affect cellular functions. MiRNAs play important roles in regulating neuronal growth, neuronal differentiation, dendritic spine morphology, and synaptic flexibility in the nervous system. The expression levels of miRNAs are changed in neurological diseases, including AD, suggesting that they play an essential role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, targeting disrupted miRNAs may be a novel therapeutic approach against AD and offers multiple solutions, including harnessing the beneficial effects of beta-amyloid, reducing tau protein, reducing neuronal cell death, and protecting synapses in AD.",

Since the number of patients grows every year and may exceed 115 million by 2050, and due to the lack of effective therapies, early prediction of AD remains a global challenge, solution of which can contribute to the timely appointment of a preventive therapy in order to avoid irreversible changes in the brain. To date, clinical assays for the markers of amyloidosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been developed, which, in conjunction with the brain MRI and PET studies, are used either to confirm the diagnosis based on obligate clinical criteria or to predict the risk of AD developing at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

In this regard, the search for new protein markers and studies of proteomic changes in CSF and blood plasma are of particular interest and may consequentially identify particular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Studies of specific proteomic changes in blood plasma deserve special attention and are of increasing interest due to the much less invasive method of sample collection as compared to CSF, which is important when choosing the object for large-scale screening. This review briefly summarizes the current knowledge on proteomic markers of AD and considers the prospects of developing reliable methods for early identification of AD risk factors based on the proteomic profile.",

Accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles are believed to be the main hallmarks of the disease. Origin of Alzheimer's disease is not totally clear, multiple initiator factors are likely to exist. Intracellular impacts of Alzheimer's disease include mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, ER-stress, disruption of autophagy, severe metabolic challenges leading to massive neuronal apoptosis. Mitochondria are the key players in all these processes. This formed the basis for the so-called mitochondrial cascade hypothesis. This review provides current data on the molecular mechanisms of the development of Alzheimer's disease associated with mitochondria. Special attention was paid to the interaction between Tau protein and mitochondria, as well as to the promising therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing development of neurodegeneration.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The missense mutation p.R406W in microtubule-associated protein tau leads to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with an amnestic, Alzheimer's disease-like phenotype with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In 2003, we described the pedigree of a Belgian family, labeled ADG, with 28 p.R406W patients. Over 18 years follow-up, we extended the family with 10 p.R406W carriers and provided an in-depth clinical description of the patients. Additionally, genetic screening was used to identify p.R406W carriers in Belgian cohorts of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease patients and to calculate p.R406W frequency. In the frontotemporal dementia cohort, we found four p.R406W carriers (n\u2009=\u2009647,0.62%) and three in the Alzheimer's disease cohort (n\u2009=\u20091134, 0.26%). Haplotype sharing analysis showed evidence of a shared haplotype suggesting that they are descendants of a common ancestor. Of the p.R406W patients, we describe characteristics of neuropsychological, imaging and fluid biomarkers as well as neuropathologic examination. Intriguingly, the phenotypic spectrum among the p.R406W patients ranged from typical behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia to clinical Alzheimer's disease, based on CSF biomarker analysis and amyloid PET scan. Heterogeneous overlap syndromes existed in between, with highly common neuropsychiatric symptoms like disinhibition and aggressiveness, which occurred in 100% of frontotemporal dementia and 58% of clinical Alzheimer's disease patients. This was also the case for memory problems, 89% in frontotemporal dementia and 100% in clinical Alzheimer's disease patients. Median age at death was significantly lower in patients with frontotemporal dementia (68 years) compared to clinical Alzheimer's disease patients (79 years), though the sizes of the sub-cohorts are limited and do not allow prognostic predictions. Postmortem brain analysis of one p.R406W patient with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia revealed frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau pathology. Notably, neuropathological investigation showed only 3R tau isoforms in the absence of 4R tau reactivity, an unusual finding in microtubule-associated protein tau-related frontotemporal lobar degeneration. No traces of amyloid pathology were present. Prevalence of the p.R406W mutation was relatively high in both frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease Belgian patient cohorts. These findings grant new insights into genotype-phenotype correlations of p.R406W carriers. They may help in further unraveling of the pathophysiology of this tauopathy and to facilitate the identification of patients with p.R406W-related frontotemporal lobar degeneration, both in clinical diagnostic and research settings.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and its pathogenesis is still unclear. There is dysbiosis of gut microbiota in AD patients. More importantly, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been observed not only in AD patients, but also in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis in AD is poorly understood. Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is an important pathway for the central nervous system (CNS) regulation of peripheral immune homeostasis, especially in the gut. Therefore, we speculated that dysfunction of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is a potential pathway for dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in AD.In this study, we constructed AD model mice by injecting A\u03b21-42 into the lateral ventricle, and detected the cognitive level of mice by the Morris water maze test. In addition, 16S rDNA high-throughput analysis was used to detect the gut microbiota abundance of each group at baseline, 2\u00a0weeks and 4\u00a0weeks after surgery. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to detect alteration of intestinal structure of mice, cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, and APP process of brain and colon in each group.A\u03b21-42 i.c.v induced cognitive impairment and neuron damage in the brain of\u00a0 mice. At the same time, A\u03b21-42 i.c.v induced alteration of gut microbiota at 4\u00a0weeks after surgery, while there was no difference at the baseline and 2\u00a0weeks after surgery. In addition, changes in colon structure and increased levels of pro-inflammatory factors were detected in A\u03b21-42 treatment group, accompanied by inhibition of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways. Amyloidogenic pathways in both the brain and colon were accelerated in A\u03b21-42 treatment group.The present findings suggested that A\u03b2 in the CNS can induce gut microbiota dysbiosis, alter intestinal structure and accelerate the amyloidogenic pathways, which were related to inhibiting cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways.",

By analyzing a total of ~20 billion read pairs, we expanded the repertoire of known open chromatin regions (OCRs) in the human brain and identified cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions. We show that interindividual variability in OCRs can be leveraged to identify cis-regulatory domains (CRDs) that capture the three-dimensional structure of the genome (3D genome). We identified AD-associated effects on chromatin accessibility, the 3D genome and transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks. For one of the most AD-perturbed TFs, USF2, we validated its regulatory effect on lysosomal genes. Overall, we applied a systematic approach to understanding the role of the 3D genome in AD.

The search for a low-cost, rapid, and minimally invasive test has marked a new era of research and technological developments toward establishing blood-based AD biomarkers. The current study has employed excitation-emission matrices (EEM) of fluorescence spectroscopy combined with machine learning to diagnose AD using blood plasma samples from 230 individuals (83 AD patients from 147 healthy controls). To evaluate the performance of the classification algorithms, we calculated the commonly used figures of merit (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) and figures of merit that take into account the samples unbalance and the discrimination power of the models, as F2-score (F2), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and test effectiveness ([Formula: see text]). The classification models achieved satisfactory results: Parallel Factor Analysis with Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (PARAFAC-QDA) with 83.33% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 86.21% F2; and Tucker3-QDA with 91.67% sensitivity, 95.45% specificity and 91.67% F2. In addition, the classifiers show high overall performance with 94.12% accuracy and 0.87 MCC. Regarding the discrimination power between healthy and AD patients, the classification algorithms showed high effectiveness with the mean scores separated by three or more standard deviations. The PARAFAC's spectral profiles and the wavelength values from both models loading profiles can be used in future research to relate this information to plasma AD biomarkers. Our results point to a rapid, low-cost and minimally invasive blood-based method for AD diagnosis.",

However, whether disruption of synaptic homeostasis results from protein misfolding per se rather than accumulation of a specific rogue protein is an unexplored question. Here, we show that error-prone translation, with its frequent outcome of random protein misfolding, is sufficient to recapitulate many early features of NDDs, including perturbed Ca2+ signaling, neuronal hyperexcitability, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mice expressing the ribosomal ambiguity mutation Rps9 D95N exhibited disrupted synaptic homeostasis resulting in behavioral changes reminiscent of early Alzheimer disease (AD), such as learning and memory deficits, maladaptive emotional responses, epileptiform discharges, suppressed circadian rhythmicity, and sleep fragmentation, accompanied by hippocampal NPY expression and cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Collectively, our findings suggest that random protein misfolding may contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related NDDs, providing an alternative framework for understanding the initiation of AD.",

In 3xTg mice, long-term FMD cycles reduce hippocampal A\u03b2 load and hyperphosphorylated tau, enhance genesis of neural stem cells, decrease microglia number, and reduce expression of neuroinflammatory genes, including superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase (Nox2). 3xTg mice lacking Nox2 or mice treated with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin also display improved cognition and reduced microglia activation compared with controls. Clinical data indicate that FMD cycles are feasible and generally safe in a small group of AD patients.

        "ArticleAbstract": "An overarching goal of aging and age-related neurodegenerative disease research is to discover effective therapeutic strategies applicable to a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Little is known about the extent to which targetable pathogenic mechanisms are shared among these seemingly diverse diseases. Translational control is critical for maintaining proteostasis during aging. Gaining control of the translation machinery is also crucial in the battle between viruses and their hosts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that overexpression of SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) robustly rescued neuromuscular degeneration and behavioral phenotypes in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These diseases share a common mechanism: the accumulation of aberrant protein species due to the stalling and collision of translating ribosomes, leading to proteostasis failure. Our genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that Nsp1 acted in a multipronged manner to resolve collided ribosomes, abort stalled translation, and remove faulty translation products causative of disease in these models, at least in part through the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, ribosome-associated quality-control factors, autophagy, and AKT signaling. Nsp1 exhibited exquisite specificity in its action, as it did not modify other neurodegenerative conditions not known to be associated with ribosome stalling. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of Nsp1 in manipulating host translation, which can be leveraged for combating age-related neurodegenerative diseases that are affecting millions of people worldwide and currently without effective treatment.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Computationally Elucidating the Binding Kinetics for Different AChE Inhibitors to Access the Rationale for Improving the Drug Efficacy.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Traditional drug discovery is based on a binding affinity (thermodynamics)-driven paradigm. Numerous examples, however, demonstrated that drug efficacy does not always depend only on binding affinity but positively correlates with binding kinetics, that is, the dissociation rate constant (koff). Binding free energy landscape (BFEL) constructor is a computational binding kinetics prediction method, previously developed by us, that estimates the binding kinetics for ligand-protein based on their constructed binding free energy landscape, but it also reveals the detailed molecular mechanism of the binding event, hence, providing the position of transition states at the molecular level to modify/improve the binding kinetics. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a well-known Alzheimer's disease (AD) target for which there is still not an ideal drug on the market. Therefore, to improve the drug design strategy for AD, the binding kinetics and binding molecular mechanisms of the four inhibitors of AChE, that is, E2020 (Aricept), HupA, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine, were studied. Also, the differentiation of the binding kinetics between mAChE and TcAChE was studied to evaluate the sensitiveness of BFEL constructor. The flexibility of molecules has a noticeable effect on the nature of BFEL. To the same target, flexible molecules (i.e., E2020 and Rivastigmine) which contain more rotatable bonds tend to have more complicated BFELs reflecting more complicated molecular action mechanisms than the rigid ones (i.e., HupA and Galantamine), which therefore could be more challenging to be optimized. The binding kinetics is highly dependent on the structure of the molecules, such as the length and the functional groups. Therefore, E2020 presents better binding kinetic and thermodynamic properties with either TcAChE or mAChE. Therefore, it is the most promising lead drug for binding kinetics-based drug design. In addition, the binding kinetics of a drug may present different values in the proteins of different organisms because the residue compositions of the binding gorges of the targets are variant, that is, E2020 shows lower binding affinity and association energy barrier in binding with mAChE than TcAChE. However, HupA presents a better binding property with TcAChE than mAChE.",

We have shown previously that coumarin derivative LM-031 enhanced CREB/BDNF/BCL2 pathway. In this study we explored if LM-031 analogs LMDS-1 to -4 may act as TRKB agonists to protect SH-SY5Y cells against A\u03b2 toxicity. By docking computation for binding with TRKB using 7,8-DHF as a control, all four LMDS compounds displayed potential of binding to domain d5 of TRKB. In addition, all four LMDS compounds exhibited anti-aggregation and neuroprotective efficacy on SH-SY5Y cells with induced A\u03b2-GFP expression. Knock-down of TRKB significantly attenuated TRKB downstream signaling and the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of these LMDS compounds.

Treatment of ERK inhibitor U0126 or PI3K inhibitor wortmannin decreased p-CREB, BDNF and BCL2 in A\u03b2-GFP cells, implicating the neuroprotective effects are via activating TRKB downstream ERK, PI3K-AKT and CREB signaling. LMDS-1 and -2 are blood-brain barrier permeable as shown by parallel artificial membrane permeability assay.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Sensory loss in olfaction, vision, and hearing is a risk factor for dementia, but the reasons for this are unclear. This review presents the neurobiological evidence linking each sensory modality to specific dementias and explores the potential mechanisms underlying this. Olfactory deficits can be linked to direct neuropathologic changes in the olfactory system due to Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, and may be a marker of disease severity. Visual deficits potentially increase dementia risk in a vulnerable individual by reducing resilience to dementia. Hearing deficits may indicate a susceptibility to Alzheimer disease through a variety of mechanisms. More generally, sensory impairment could be related to factors associated with resilience against dementia. Further research is needed to tease out the specific and synergistic effects of sensory impairment. Studying sensory loss in relation to neurodegenerative biomarkers is necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved. This could produce new monitoring and management strategies for people at risk of dementia.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Therapeutic approaches of nutraceuticals in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological illness that causes memory loss over time. Currently, available pharmaceutical medicines and products are limited, and they have side effects at a higher price. Researchers and scientists have observed significant effects of nutraceuticals. Various preclinical and clinical studies were investigated for the Anti-Alzheimer's activity of nutraceuticals. The increasing ability of the pathogenesis of AD has led to the analysis of novel therapeutic targets, including the pathophysiological mechanisms and distinct cascades. So, current improvement will show the most adequate and prominent nutraceuticals and suggested concise mechanisms involving autophagy regulation, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, mitochondrial homeostasis, and others. The effects of nutraceuticals cannot be ignored; it is important to investigate high-quality clinical trials. Given the potential of nutraceuticals to battle AD as multi-targeted therapies, it's vital to evaluate them as viable lead compounds for drug discovery and development. To the best of the authors 'knowledge, modification of blood-brain barrier permeability, bioavailability, and aspects of randomized clinical trials should be considered in prospective investigations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Advancements in molecular diagnostic and fundamentals have implemented particular usefulness for drug evaluation. An excess of experimental knowledge occurs regarding the effect of nutraceuticals on AD. There are various preclinical and clinical studies that have been done on nutraceuticals. In addition, various substitute inhibit and enhance some pathophysiological levels associated with AD. Nutraceuticals are easily available and have fewer side effects with cost-effective advantages. However, further investigations and clinical trials are required to encourage its effect on disease.",

        "ArticleTitle": "[Potential biomarkers of early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease].",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain, in which there are cognitive and behavioral disorders, but also visual impairment can occur. Deposits of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) were also found in the retina of AD patients. At the same time, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) occupies the first place among geronto-ophthalmic pathologies in patients with AD. POAG, like AD, is a neurodegenerative disease. AD and POAG have common symptoms, and therefore several common principles for their early diagnosis can be developed. Therefore, a promising direction is the search for biomarkers for the early detection of AD and POAG. Currently, the diagnosis of early AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and biomarkers in the brain (imaging of amyloid plaques and tau positron emission tomography) are well studied, while data in literature on using these biomarkers in patients with POAG is scarce. However, the above diagnostic methods are not considered in routine clinical practice due to their invasiveness and high cost. There is a growing need for conventional, affordable biomarkers for AD and POAG, as it is necessary to start treatment of prodromal conditions from symptoms to onset of symptoms. In this connection, biomarkers such as A\u03b2 and tau protein in blood serum and plasma are actively evaluated in patients with AD. In patients with POAG, there is no published data on studies of these biomarkers, which requires scientific research. Many authors discover the role of sirtuins (SIRT) in aging and age-related diseases, such as AD, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and others. Possibly, SIRT could become potential biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases.\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430

Five algorithms of increasing strictness considered inpatient/outpatient diagnoses (#1, #2), antidementia drugs (#3) or supportive diagnostics (#4, #5).Algorithm 1 detected 213,409 cases (#2: 197,400; #3: 48,688; #4: 3033; #5: 3105), a prevalence for any dementia of 3.44 and an IR of 1.39 (AD: 0.80/0.21, VD: 0.79/0.31). The prevalence decreased by algorithms for any dementia (#2: 3.19; #3: 0.75; #4: 0.04; #5: 0.05) as did IRs (#2: 1.13; #3: 0.18; #4: 0.05, #5: 0.05). Algorithms 1-2, and 4-5 revealed similar proportions of AD (23.3%-26.6%), VD (19.9%-23.2%), and oD (53.1%-53.8%), algorithm 3 estimated 45% (AD), 12.1% (VD), and 43.0% (oD).Health claims data show lower estimates of AD than previously reported, due to markedly lower prevalent/incident proportions of patients with corresponding codes. Using medication in defining dementia potentially improves estimating the proportion of AD while supportive diagnostics were of limited use.",

Sleep disturbances are common in LBD, and can include poor sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and rapid eye movement behaviour disorder (RBD). Despite the high clinical prevalence of sleep disturbances in LBD, they are under-studied relative to other dementias. The aim of the present systematic review was to examine the nature of sleep disturbances in LBD, summarise the effect of treatment studies upon sleep, and highlight specific and necessary directions for future research.Published studies in English were located by searching PubMED and PSYCArticles databases (until 10 June 2022). The search protocol was pre-registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021293490) and performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.Following full-text review, a final total of 70 articles were included. These included 20 studies focussing on subjective sleep, 14 on RBD, 8 on EDS, 7 on objective sleep, and 1 on circadian rhythms. The majority of the 18 treatment studies used pharmacological interventions (n\u00a0=\u00a012), had an open-label design (n\u00a0=\u00a08), and were of low-to-moderate quality. Most studies (n\u00a0=\u00a055) included only patients with DLB. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, we reported a narrative synthesis without meta-analysis.At least one form of sleep disturbance may be present in as many as 90% of people with LBD. Subjectively poor sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and RBD are more common and severe in LBD relative to other dementias.",

Recent evidence has indicated that elderly people with dementia are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and severe disease outcomes. However, its molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we retrieved frontal cortex samples of COVID-19 patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus\u00a0database and performed a systematic transcriptomic analysis to compare COVID-19 patients and controls with or without dementia. In nondemented patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection obviously activated T helper type 2 (Th2) cell-mediated humoral immunity and reduced the pathogenesis of dementia-related Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In demented patients, conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased T helper type 1 (Th1) cell-mediated cellular immunity and exacerbated the progression of dementia-related diseases. We further analyzed the molecular characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without dementia. Compared with nondemented COVID-19 patients, demented COVID-19 patients showed decreased enrichment scores of Calcium signaling pathway, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, ABC transporters, and Peroxisome, and increased enrichment scores of Olfactory transduction and Regulation of autophagy. The ratio of Th1/Th2 cells was significantly increased from 1.17 in nondemented COVID-19 patients to 33.32 in demented COVID-19 patients. Taken together, our findings provide transcriptomic evidence that COVID-19 has distinct influences on cognitive function and immune response in patients with and without dementia.",

To understand how dementia caregivers experienced FSP services after the switch to video telehealth, we conducted qualitative interviews of spouse or partner dementia caregivers.Ten participants were recruited from a convenience sample of dementia spouse or partner caregivers who used one or more online FSP services offered during the pandemic.Caregivers engaged in semi-structured interviews held via videoconference between May and June 2020. Qualitative analysis of interviews was conducted according to the principles of framework analysis.Caregivers reported high satisfaction with the FSP pre-pandemic and continued to feel supported when services were provided online. They transitioned to video telehealth services with little difficulty.While video telehealth is frequently cited as beneficial for those in rural communities, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, or homebound individuals, our findings suggest that video telehealth is also advantageous for dementia caregivers, given their unique barriers, including lack of time due to caregiving responsibilities, lack of respite care for the person with dementia, and the additional burdens of travel time to access in-person services.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) decrease long-term cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, there is little evidence that ChEIs affect cognitive test scores in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Conventional endpoints, such as cognitive tests or clinical rating scores, may lack the sensitivity to subtle treatment effects in participants with MCI. Therefore, there is an immediate need to refocus on direct physiological assessments to detect the effects of ChEIs in patients with MCI due to AD.We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of donepezil, a ChEI, on patients with MCI due to AD. We plan to recruit 78 participants (39 in each arm) with MCI who had amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)-positive results for this open-label study. To evaluate subtle differences, we will measure eye-tracking metrics and digital pen data while participants perform the simplified Rey Complex Figure (RCFT) and clock drawing tests. The primary outcome is a change in the ratio of the number of fixations (working space/perceptual space) performed using the simplified RCFT, from baseline to 12\u00a0weeks, as assessed using eye-tracking metrics. The secondary outcomes are changes in general cognition, clinical severity, activities of daily living, and visuospatial function assessed using standard rating scores and digital pen data. The analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be based on the difference in changes during follow-up between the donepezil and control groups using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as well as adjusting for baseline values.This study is designed to determine whether eye-tracking metrics can detect the effect of donepezil on visuospatial dysfunction more sensitively in patients with MCI. It is expected that multimodal data, such as eye-tracking and digital pen data, may provide helpful biomarkers for identifying subtle changes that are difficult to measure using conventional methods.Clinical Research Information Service, Republic of Korea (CRIS, cris.nih.go.kr) KCT0006236.

        "ArticleAbstract": "A diverse heterogeneity of microglial cells was previously described in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, including dark microglia, a state characterized by ultrastructural markers of cellular stress. To provide novel insights into the roles of dark microglia during aging in the context of AD pathology, we performed a quantitative density and ultrastructural analysis of these cells using high-throughput scanning electron microscopy in the ventral hippocampus CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare of 20-month-old APP-PS1 vs C57BL/6J male mice. The density of dark microglia was significantly higher in APP-PS1 vs C57BL/6J mice, with these cells accounting for nearly half of all microglia observed near amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques. This dark microglial state interacted more with dystrophic neurites compared to other APP-PS1 microglia and possessed glycogen granules, associated with a metabolic shift toward glycolysis, which provides the first ultrastructural evidence of their presence in microglia. Dark microglia were further observed in aging human post-mortem brain samples showing similar ultrastructural features as in mouse. Overall, our results provide a quantitative ultrastructural characterization of a microglial state associated with cellular stress (i.e., dark microglia) that is primarily restricted near A\u03b2 plaques and dystrophic neurites. The presence of this microglial state in the aging human post-mortem brain is further revealed.",

Thus, its contribution to Alzheimer's disease merits attention, given the known impact of the prostaglandin E2 pathway in Alzheimer's disease. We used the TgF344-AD transgenic rat model because it exhibits age-dependent and progressive Alzheimer's disease pathology. Prostaglandin D2 levels in hippocampi of TgF344-AD and wild-type littermates were significantly higher than prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin D2 signals through DP1 and DP2 receptors. Microglial DP1 receptors were more abundant and neuronal DP2 receptors were fewer in TgF344-AD than in wild-type rats. Expression of the major brain prostaglandin D2 synthase (lipocalin-type PGDS) was the highest among 33 genes involved in the prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 pathways. We treated a subset of rats (wild-type and TgF344-AD males) with timapiprant, a potent highly selective DP2 antagonist in development for allergic inflammation treatment. Timapiprant significantly mitigated Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive deficits in TgF344-AD males.

A breakthrough discovery enabled the creation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that can be differentiated into various brain cell types, facilitating AD research in genetically human models. Herein, we provide a brief background on AD in the context of APOE susceptibility and feature work employing hiPSC-derived brain cell and tissue models to interrogate the contribution of APOE in driving AD pathology. Such models have delivered crucial insights into cellular mechanisms and cell type-specific roles underlying the perturbed biological functions that trigger pathogenic cascades and propagate neurodegeneration.

Multi-modality data-driven approaches have been used to discover MCI subtypes; however, disease comorbidities have not been included as a modality though multiple diseases including hypertension are well-known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to examine MCI heterogeneity in the context of AD-related comorbidities along with other AD-relevant features and biomarkers.A total of 325 MCI subjects with 32 AD-relevant comorbidities and features were considered. Mixed-data clustering is applied to discover and compare MCI subtypes with and without including AD-related comorbidities. Finally, the relevance of each comorbidity-driven subtype was determined by examining their MCI to AD disease prognosis, descriptive statistics, and conversion rates.We identified four (five) MCI subtypes: poor-, average-, good-, and best-AD prognosis by including comorbidities (without including comorbidities). We demonstrated that comorbidity-driven MCI subtypes differed from those identified without comorbidity information. We further demonstrated the clinical relevance of comorbidity-driven MCI subtypes. Among the four comorbidity-driven MCI subtypes there were substantial differences in the proportions of participants who reverted to normal function, remained stable, or converted to AD. The groups showed different behaviors, having significantly different MCI to AD prognosis, significantly different means for cognitive test-related and plasma features, and by the proportion of comorbidities.Our study indicates that AD comorbidities should be considered along with other diverse AD-relevant characteristics to better understand MCI heterogeneity.",

In CAHPS measures, the term provider can include hospitals, home health care agencies, and doctors, among others.The final sample included 568\u202f368 beneficiaries (347\u202f783 female patients [61.2%]; 38\u202f030 African American patients [6.69%], 6258 Asian patients [1.10%], 18\u202f231 Hispanic patients [3.21%], and 505\u202f849 White patients [89.0%]; mean [SD] age, 82.17 [7.95] years). Significant racial and ethnic disparities in CAHPS scores were observed. After controlling for beneficiary, hospital, and area characteristics, compared with their White counterparts, African American or Black (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-1.05; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.95; P\u2009<\u2009.001), Asian (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.414; 95% CI, -0.623 to -0.205; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and Hispanic (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.099; 95% CI, -0.229 to 0.032; P\u2009=\u2009.14) patients with ADRD reported lower total CAHPS scores. Disparities were also observed among individual ACO CAHPS. Decomposition results showed that a proxy for social determinants of health explained 10% to 13% of disparities of ACO CAHPS between African American or Black vs White and Hispanic vs White patients with ADRD. Most of the racial and ethnic disparities, especially those between White and Asian individuals, could not be explained by the models used to analyze data.These results demonstrated significant variations in CAHPS by race and ethnicity among patients with ADRD enrolled in ACOs. Social determinants of health are critical in explaining racial and ethnic disparities. More research is needed to explain disparities in CAHPS.",

Higher blood pressure (BP) is associated with cerebrovascular disease and is an important contributor to cognitive decline and dementia.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 24 weeks of S-amlodipine besylate therapy on cognitive function in patients with hypertension and cerebrovascular disease.The data were obtained from a study of post-market surveillance of S-amlodipine besylate.A total of 545 subjects (mean age 67 \u00b1 9.68 years) with hypertension and ischemic cerebrovascular disease were enrolled. Patients with a baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score above 26 were assigned to the cognitive normal (CN) (n\u00a0=\u00a0294) group, and those with MMSE score less than 26 were in the cognitive decline (CD) (n\u00a0=\u00a0251) group. After 24 weeks of treatment with S-amlodipine besylate 5 mg, MMSE and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) were evaluated again. Changes in MMSE were compared in the target BP reached (TBPR) and non-reached (NTBPR) groups and for CN and CD groups. Treatment with 5 mg of S-amlodipine besylate for 24 weeks improved MMSE and GDS scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The CD group showed improvement in MMSE score regardless of whether target BP was obtained (TBPR: p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, NTBPR: p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). However, the CN classification was not significant for either TBPR or NTBPR groups.S-amlodipine besylate improved cognition of the CD group with hypertension and cerebrovascular disease regardless of obtaining target BP.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Photoperiod determines the metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and affects the food intake and body mass of mammals. Sympathetic innervation of the BAT controls thermogenesis and facilitates physiological adaption to seasonal changes, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that central opioid signaling regulates BAT thermogenesis, and that the expression of the brain mu-opioid receptor (MOR) varies seasonally. Therefore, it is important to know whether MOR expression in BAT shows seasonal variation.We determined the effect of photoperiod on BAT MOR availability using [11C]carfentanil positron emission tomography (PET). Adult rats (n\u2009=\u20099) were repeatedly imaged under various photoperiods in order to simulate seasonal changes.Long photoperiod was associated with low MOR expression in BAT (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.04, 95% confidence interval:\u2009-\u20090.07,\u2009-\u20090.01), but not in muscles. We confirmed the expression of MOR in BAT and muscle using immunofluorescence staining.Photoperiod affects MOR availability in BAT. Sympathetic innervation of BAT may influence thermogenesis via the peripheral MOR system. The present study supports the utility of [11C]carfentanil PET to study the peripheral MOR system.",

As AD progresses, CD8+ T cells infiltrate into the brain parenchyma, where they tightly associate with neurons and microglia. The functional properties of CD8+ T cells in the brain are largely unknown. To gain further insights into the putative functions of CD8+ T cells in the brain, we explored and compared the transcriptomic profile of CD8+ T cells isolated from the brain and blood of transgenic AD (APPswe/PSEN1dE9, line 85 [APP-PS1]) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Brain CD8+ T cells of APP-PS1 and WT animals had similar transcriptomic profiles and substantially differed from blood circulating CD8+ T cells. The gene signature of brain CD8+ T cells identified them as tissue-resident memory (Trm) T cells. Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis on the significantly upregulated genes revealed overrepresentation of biological processes involved in IFN-\u03b2 signaling and the response to viral infections. Furthermore, brain CD8+ T cells of APP-PS1 and aged WT mice showed similar differentially regulated genes as brain Trm CD8+ T cells in mouse models with acute virus infection, chronic parasite infection, and tumor growth. In conclusion, our profiling of brain CD8+ T cells suggests that in AD, these cells exhibit similar adaptive immune responses as in other inflammatory diseases of the CNS, potentially opening the door for immunotherapy in AD.",

Acteoside has shown its therapeutic potential for AD treatment. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of acteoside on A\u03b2-induced blood-brain barrier damage, oxidative stress and apoptosis as well as to explore the underlying mechanisms through network pharmacology.The study used A\u03b2 to induce human BMECs to construct an in-vitro injury model. Following treatment with acteoside, transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to evaluate the permeability of BMECs. The apoptosis level was detected by TUNEL and Western blot, ROS assay kit was used for the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression. The let-7g-5p expression level was detected by RT-qPCR. After additional treatment with let-7g-5p inhibitor, corresponding assays were performed again. Finally, network pharmacology was used to verify the mechanism.Acteoside decreased the permeability, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis of A\u03b2-stimulated cells. More importantly, acteoside-activated let-7g-5p and additional treatment with let-7g-5p inhibitor abated the effects of acteoside on A\u03b2-induced permeability, oxidative stress and apoptosis of A\u03b2-stimulated BMECs. According to network pharmacology, 233 targeted genes of acteoside and 122 potential targets of let-7g-5p were determined by screening several databases, and two targets called Casp-3 and ITGB3 were obtained after taking the intersection.In conclusion, these results reveal that acteoside-activated let-7g-5p attenuating A\u03b2-induced increased permeability and apoptosis of human BMECs.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia is characterized by profound changes in personality and behavior that often start before the age of 65\u00a0years. These symptoms impact family life, particularly if (adult) children live at home. In research on young-onset dementia or frontotemporal dementia, the family itself is hardly ever a unit of analysis. Insight in the perspectives of different family members from the same household helps to obtain a deeper understanding of the complex impact of the symptoms on family dynamics.This case study explored the perspectives of one family having a relative with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia living at home. Over the course of 4\u00a0months, different family members were individually interviewed twice. Two authors independently performed a directed content analysis.The family consisted of a father, mother, and three adult children. Around 3\u00a0years before the interviews the father was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.The main category identified was the change in family dynamics over the disease trajectory. Three subcategories characterized the changing family dynamics, namely (a) the change in existing roles, relationships and interaction patterns in the family due to early symptoms, (b) a redefinition of roles and responsibility in the family once the diagnosis was established, and (c) the formation of new roles, relationships and interaction patterns in the family by organizing post-diagnostic support at home.Symptoms of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia have a complex and profound impact on family dynamics and change existing roles, relationships, and interaction patterns. Psychosocial support may help families by accounting for individual differences in involvement, coping, and bereavement. This may help to create a sense of mutual understanding between family members that could potentially strengthen their relationship. This may help families to deal with the difficult challenge of organizing care for a relative with frontotemporal dementia who lives at home.",

This study preliminarily investigated the mechanism of Atractylodes macrocephala(AM) against AD based on LKB1-AMPK-TFEB pathway. The effect of AM on memory ability of AD transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2241 was detected, and then the APP plasmid was transiently transferred to mouse neuroblastoma(N2 a) cells in vitro. The mice were divided into the blank control group, APP group(model group), positive control group(100 \u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1) rapamycin), and AM low-, medium-and high-dose groups(100, 200 and 300 \u03bcg\u00b7mL~(-1)). The content of A\u03b2_(1-42) in cell medium, the protein level of APP, the fluorescence intensity of APP, the transcriptional activity of transcription factor EB(TFEB), the activity of lysosomes in autophagy, and autophagy flux were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA), Western blot, fluorescence microscope, luciferase reporter gene assay, RLuc-LC3 wt/RLuc-LC3 G120 A, and mRFP-GFP-LC3, respectively. The protein expression of TFEB, LC3\u2161, LC3\u2160, LAMP2, Beclin1, LKB1, p-AMPK and p-ACC was detected by Western blot. Immunofluorescence and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) were used to detect the fluorescence intensity of TFEB and the mRNA expression of TFEB and downstream target genes, respectively. The results showed that AM reduced the chemotactic index of transgenic C. elegans CL2241, and decreased the content of A\u03b2 in the supernatant of cell culture medium at different concentrations. In addition, AM lowered the protein level of APP and the fluorescence intensity of APP in a dose-dependent manner. Transcriptional activity of TFEB and fluorescence intensity of mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid were enhanced after AM treatment, and the value of RLuc-LC3 wt/RLuc-LC3 G120 A was reduced. AM promoted the protein levels of TFEB, LAMP2 and Beclin1 at different concentrations, and increased the protein expression ratio of LC3\u2161/LC3\u2160 in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence results revealed that AM improved the fluorescence intensity and nuclear expression of TFEB, and RT-PCR results indicated that AM of various concentrations elevated the mRNA expression of TFEB in APP transfected N2 a cells and promoted the transcription level of LAMP2 in a dose-dependent manner, and high-concentration AM also increased the mRNA levels of LC3 and P62. The protein levels of LKB1, p-AMPK and p-ACC were elevated by AM of different concentrations. In summary, AM regulating lysophagy and degrading APP are related to the activation of LKB1-AMPK-TFEB pathway.",

AD patients had increased extracellular amyloid \u03b2 plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in neurons. Recent studies have shown an association between the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) and AD. The involvement of RAS has been mediated through Angiotensin II (AngII), which is overexpressed in aging brains. However, the exact mechanism of how AngII contributes to AD is unknown. Thus, we hypothesize that AngII increases p-tau by activating its kinases, CDK5 and MAPK. In the human cortical neuron cell line, HCN2, treatment with AngII upregulated the gene expression of CDK5 (2.9 folds, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and MAPTK (1.9 folds, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The AT1R antagonist, Losartan, blocked the changes in tau kinases. Also, AngII-induced the MAPK activation, increasing its phosphorylation by 400% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), an increase that was also blocked by Losartan. An increase in p-tau by AngII was observed using fluorescent microscopy. We then quantified Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, and it was significantly increased by AngII (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and treatment with Losartan blunted their production (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Recently discovered hallmark features responsible for AD pathogenesis are neuronal insulin resistance, dysregulation in adiponectin and AMPK signaling. The presence of adiponectin and its receptor in the brain with its unique anti-diabetic effects and association with neurodegenerative diseases has raised our interest in exploring orally active small molecule adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon. To date, all the available drugs for the treatment of AD provides symptomatic relief and do not stall the progression of the disease. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent to find appropriate targets. Here, we attempt to shed lights on adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon and its downstream molecular targets in reducing disease pathogenesis and insulin resistance. In brain, AdipoRon induced AMPK activation, increased insulin sensitivity, reduced amyloid beta plaque deposition and improved cognitive impairment. Levels of BACE were also downregulated while LDLR, APOE and neprilysin were upregulated promoting amyloid beta clearance from brain. AdipoRon further reduced the chronic inflammatory marker, GFAP and improved synaptic markers PSD-95 and synaptophysin in APP/PS1 mice. Our in-vitro studies further confirmed the potential role of AdipoRon in improving insulin sensitivity by increasing GLUT 4 translocation, glucose uptake and insulin signaling under hyperinsulinemic condition. Our findings suggest that AdipoRon could be a promising lead in the future treatment strategies in the development of effective AD treatment.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD) is an intellectual disorder caused by organic brain damage and cerebral atrophy, characterized by the loss of memory, judgment, and abstract thinking followed by declining cognitive functions, language, and the ability to perform daily living activities. Many efforts have been made to decrease the effects of the disease but also to block the neurodegenerative process. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are a group of medicines that act at the neurotransmission of acetylcholine, preventing its excessive breakdown and helping to improve cognitive functions in patients with AD. In this work, 16 chiral steroids, namely ring-fused 3\u03b2-acetoxyandrost-5-ene derivatives, their precursor and two 16-dehydroprogesterone-derived dioximes, were assessed as cholinesterase inhibitors and neuroprotective agents. The results demonstrated that some of the tested steroids are cholinesterase inhibitors and the majority selective for acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Albeit, one ring-fused 3\u03b2-acetoxyandrost-5-ene containing N-methylpiperidine ring (compound 2g) demonstrated to be a selective and potent inhibitor of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme. (S)-\u00a04,4a,5,6,7,8-(hexahydronaphthalen-2-one)-fused 3\u03b2-acetoxyandrost-5-ene (compound 6) showed high neuroprotective effect, high ability to restore the mitochondrial membrane potential from glutamate intoxication, and dramatic improvement in cell morphology. The described results provided relevant structure-activity relationship data.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "A\u03b2 cascade hypothesis being considered most evident event in AD pathology and even today it holds good. Dysregulation of catalytic events of A\u03b2 regulating enzymes can possibly cause faulty A\u03b2 trafficking; inequity of A\u03b2 formation and clearance resulting in misfolded protein accumulation, neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Many novel approaches have been made on this pathway to discover new molecules, unfortunately couldn't reach the terminal phases of clinical trials. Over decades, studies have been more focused on enzyme chemistry and explored the relationship between structural features and catalytic function of A\u03b2 regulating enzymes. However, the modulations of catalytic mechanisms of those enzymes have not been imposed so far to reduce the A\u03b2 load. Hence, in this review, we have critically detailed the knowledge of basic structural dynamics and possible catalytic modulations of enzymes responsible for A\u03b2 formation and clearance that will impart new perspectives in drug discovery process.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Biased G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands, which preferentially activate G protein or \u03b2-arrestin signaling pathways, are leading to the development of drugs with superior efficacy and reduced side effects in heart disease, pain management, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Although GPCRs are implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), biased GPCR signaling is a largely unexplored area of investigation in AD. Our previous work demonstrated that GPR3-mediated \u03b2-arrestin signaling modulates amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) generation in\u00a0vitro and that Gpr3 deficiency ameliorates A\u03b2 pathology in\u00a0vivo. However, Gpr3-deficient mice display several adverse phenotypes, including elevated anxiety-like behavior, reduced fertility, and memory impairment, which are potentially associated with impaired G protein signaling. Here, we generated a G protein-biased GPR3 mouse model to investigate the physiological and pathophysiological consequences of selective elimination of GPR3-mediated \u03b2-arrestin signaling in\u00a0vivo. In contrast to Gpr3-deficient mice, G protein-biased GPR3 mice do not display elevated anxiety levels, reduced fertility, or cognitive impairment. We further determined that G protein-biased signaling reduces soluble A\u03b2 levels and leads to a decrease in the area and compaction of amyloid plaques in the preclinical App AD mouse model. The changes in amyloid pathology are accompanied by robust microglial and astrocytic hypertrophy, which suggest a protective glial response that may limit amyloid plaque development in G protein-biased GPR3 AD mice. Collectively, these studies indicate that GPR3-mediated G protein and \u03b2-arrestin signaling produce discrete and separable effects and provide proof of concept for the development of safer GPCR-targeting therapeutics with more directed pharmacological action for AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Through synaptic connections, long-range circuits transmit information among neurons and connect different brain regions to form functional motifs and execute specific functions. Tracing the synaptic distribution of specific neurons requires submicron-level resolution information. However, it is a great challenge to map the synaptic terminals completely because these fine structures span multiple regions, even in the whole brain. Here, we develop a pipeline including viral tracing, sample embedding, fluorescent micro-optical sectional tomography, and big data processing. We mapped the whole-brain distribution and architecture of long projections of the parvalbumin neurons in the basal forebrain at the synaptic level. These neurons send massive projections to multiple downstream regions with subregional preference. With three-dimensional reconstruction in the targeted areas, we found that synaptic degeneration was inconsistent with the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques but was preferred in memory-related circuits, such as hippocampal formation and thalamus, but not in most hypothalamic nuclei in 8-month-old mice with five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations. Our pipeline provides a platform for generating a whole-brain atlas of cell-type-specific synaptic terminals in the physiological and pathological brain, which can provide an important resource for the study of the organizational logic of specific neural circuits and the circuitry changes in pathological conditions.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Natural products have significantly contributed to drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases. Caffeine is one of the well-known central nervous system(CNS)-active natural products. Besides its CNS stimulant properties, it is a mild inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and possesses memory-enhancing properties. The present work aimed to improve the AChE inhibition activity of the caffeine. The rationally designed caffeine-based triazoles were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for cholinesterase and \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) inhibitory activities. The attachment of triazole to the caffeine enhances its AChE inhibition activity from half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) of 129 \u00b5M\u00a0to\u00a00.49\u2009\u00b5M (derivative, 6l). The caffeine core interacts with the peripheral anionic site, whereas the benzyl triazole occupies the catalytic anionic site located at the bottom of the active site gorge. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the four-atom ester linker is superior to shorter linkers for connecting the caffeine core to the triazole. The 2,6-difluorobenzyl triazole-linked caffeine derivative, 6d, exhibits dual inhibition of AChE and BACE-1 with IC50 values of 1.43 and 10.9\u2009\u00b5M, respectively. The derivative 6d inhibits AChE via a mixed-type mode with an inhibition rate constant\u00a0(Ki ) value of 2.35\u2009\u03bcM, which was corroborated by docking studies. The triazole 6d has an acceptable stability profile in human liver microsomes (t1/2 \u2009=\u200954\u2009min) and was found to possess\u00a0CNS permeability\u00a0when evaluated using the parallel artificial membrane permeability blood-brain barrier assay.

This offers potential for dementia prevention, but mainly low and variable rates of progression to AD dementia reduce the usefulness of trials' data in decision making by potential prescribers. With results from several Phase 3 secondary prevention studies anticipated within the next few years and the Food and Drug Administration's recent endorsement of amyloid beta as a surrogate outcome biomarker for AD clinical trials, it is time to question the clinical significance of changes in biomarkers, adequacy of current trial durations, and criteria for treatment success if cognitively unimpaired patients and their doctors are to meaningfully evaluate the potential value of new agents.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by the abnormal accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), is the most prevalent type of dementia, and it is associated with progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. A\u03b2 accumulation activates microglia, which secrete proinflammatory factors associated with A\u03b2 clearance impairment and cause neurotoxicity, generating a vicious cycle among A\u03b2 accumulation, activated microglia, and proinflammatory factors. Blocking this cycle can be a therapeutic strategy for AD. Using A\u03b2-activated HMC3 microglial cells, we observed that isorhamnetin, a main constituent of Oenanthe javanica, reduced the A\u03b2-triggered secretion of interleukin- (IL-) 6 and downregulated the expression levels of the microglial activation markers ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) and CD11b and the inflammatory marker nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Treatment of the SH-SY5Y-derived neuronal cells with the A\u03b2-activated HMC3-conditioned medium (HMC3-conditioned medium) or IL-6 increased reactive oxygen species production, upregulated cleaved caspase 3 expression, and reduced neurite outgrowth, whereas treatment with isorhamnetin counteracted these neurodegenerative presentations. In the SH-SY5Y-derived neuronal cells, IL-6 upregulated the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), whereas isorhamnetin normalized this abnormal phosphorylation. Overexpression of TYK2 attenuated the neuroprotective effect of isorhamnetin on IL-6-induced neurotoxicity. Our findings demonstrate that isorhamnetin exerts its neuroprotective effect by mediating the neuroinflammatory IL-6/TYK2 signaling pathway, suggesting its potential for treating AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Background: NLRP3 inflammasome has been of great interest in the field of neurological diseases. To visualize the research hotspots and evolutionary trends in this area, we collected the relevant articles in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2010 to 2022 and analyzed them using CiteSpace software. Methods: We performed a systematic search of the literature within the Web of Science Core Collection database using the strategy described below: TS = NLRP3 inflammasome AND TS = neurological diseases OR TS = neurological disorder OR TS = brain disorder OR TS = brain injury OR TS = central nervous system disease OR TS = CNS disease OR TS = central nervous system disorder OR TS = CNS disorder AND Language = English from 2010 to 2022. The type of literature was limited to articles and reviews. The data were processed using CiteSpace software (version 5.8. R3). Results: A total of 1,217 literature from 67 countries/regions and 337 research institutions was retrieved. Publications in this area have increased rapidly since 2013. China presents the highest number of published articles, but the United States has a higher centrality and h-index. The top five most published institutions and authors are from China, Zhejiang University and Li Y ranking first, respectively. Of the ten most cited articles, Prof. Heneka MT and colleagues accounted for three of them. In terms of the co-occurrence keyword diagram, the five most frequent keywords are \"nlrp3 inflammasome\", \"activation\", \"oxidative stress\", \"expression\", and \"alzheimers disease\". Conclusion: The research of NLRP3 inflammasome in neurological disorders is overall developing well. Chinese scholars contributed the most significant number of articles, while researchers from developed countries presented more influential papers. The importance of NLRP3 inflammasome in neurological diseases is widely appreciated, and the mechanism is under study. Moreover, NLRP3 inflammasome is emerging as a promising therapeutic target in treating neurological disorders. However, despite decades of research, our understanding of NLRP3 inflammasome in central nervous system diseases is still lacking. More and more profound research is needed in the future.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Several studies have shown that neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease [PD] and Alzheimer's disease [AD]) are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the causality and direction of their associations remain unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have explored the causal effects of IBD on PD and AD. However, only a few studies examined this reverse association. Thus, this study aimed to explore whether there are causal associations of genetically predicted PD and AD with IBD, using a two-sample MR study.Summary statistics for IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, which included the International IBD Genetics Consortium and the UK IBD Genetics Consortium (n=59,957). Genetic variants associated with the largest meta-analysis of GWAS of PD (n=1,474,097) and AD (n=455,258) were used as instrumental variables. We used multiple methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and Robust Adjusted Profile Score (RAPS) methods, to estimate the effects of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD. To confirm the validity of the analysis, we also evaluated the pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis that drive causal associations.The results of the IVW method, WM, and RAPS showed that genetically predicted PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of UC (odds ratio [OR]IVW=1.068, OR WM=1.107, OR RAPS=1.069, all P<0.05). Additionally, we found that there were significant associations of genetically predicted PD with CD (OR IVW=1.064, OR RAPS=1.065, all P<0.05) and IBD (OR IVW=1.062, OR RAPS=1.063, all P<0.05) using the IVW method and RAPS. However, there was no significant causal evidence of genetically predicted AD in IBD, UC, or CD among all MR methods. In all MR analyses, there were no horizontal pleiotropy (all P>0.05), or statistical heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis results of the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that the causal effect estimations of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD were robust.Our MR study corroborated a causal association between genetically predicted PD and IBD but did not support a causal effect of genetically predicted AD on IBD. More animal experiments or population-based observational studies are required to clarify the underlying mechanisms of PD and IBD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Immune system dysfunction has been proven to be an important pathological event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as a transitional stage between normal cognitive function and AD, was an important research object for the screening of early diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for AD. However, systematic assessment of peripheral immune system changes in MCI patients and consistent analysis with that in the CNS were still lacking.Peripheral blood transcriptome data from the AddNeuroMed Cohort (n = 711) was used as a training dataset to assess the abundance of 24 immune cells through ImmuCellAI and to identify MCI-related immune signaling pathways and hub genes. The expression level of the immune hub gene was validated in peripheral blood (n = 587) and brain tissue (78 entorhinal cortex, 140 hippocampi, 91 temporal cortex, and 232 frontal cortex) validation datasets. Finally, reliable immune hub genes were applied for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and correlation analysis of AD pathological characteristics.MCI patients have early changes in the abundance of various types of immune cells in peripheral blood, accompanied by significant changes in NF-kB, TNF, JAK-STAT, and MAPK signaling pathways. Five hub immune-related differentially expressed genes (NFKBIA, CD4, RELA, CASP3, and HSP90AA1) were screened by the cytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Their expression levels were significantly correlated with infiltration score and the abundance of monocytes, natural killer cells, Th2 T cells, T follicular helper cells, and cytotoxic T cells. After validation with independent datasets derived from peripheral blood and brain, RELA and HSP90AA1 were identified as two reliable immune hub genes in MCI patients and had consistent changes in AD. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that their expression levels were closely associated with Alzheimer's disease, JAK-STAT, calcium signaling pathway, etc. In addition, the expression level of RELA was positively correlated with \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase activity and Braak stage. The expression level of HSP90AA1 was negatively correlated with \u03b1- and \u03b2-secretase activity.Immune system dysfunction was an early event in AD.

This study aims to use the machine-learning models and deep-learning networks to identify key features of eye movements in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) under specific visual tasks, thereby facilitating computer-aided diagnosis of AD. Firstly, a three-dimensional (3D) visuospatial memory task is designed to provide participants with visual stimuli while their eye-movement data are recorded and used to build an eye-tracking dataset. Then, we propose a novel deep-learning-based model for identifying patients with Alzheimer's Disease (PwAD) and healthy controls (HCs) based on the collected eye-movement data. The proposed model utilizes a nested autoencoder network to extract the eye-movement features from the generated fixation heatmaps and a weight adaptive network layer for the feature fusion, which can preserve as much useful information as possible for the final binary classification. To fully verify the performance of the proposed model, we also design two types of models based on traditional machine-learning and typical deep-learning for comparison. Furthermore, we have also done ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each module of the proposed network. Finally, these models are evaluated by four-fold cross-validation on the built eye-tracking dataset. The proposed model shows 85% average accuracy in AD recognition, outperforming machine-learning methods and other typical deep-learning networks.",

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of rTMS on global cognitive function in patients with AD.An integrated literature search using 4 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) was performed to identify English language articles published up to October 6, 2021. We pooled Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores using a random-effects model via RevMan 5.4 software. We calculated estimates of mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcomes were pre-post treatment changes in global cognition as measured using MMSE and ADAS-Cog immediately after rTMS treatment, and the secondary outcome was duration of cognitive improvement (1-1.5 and \u22653 months).Nine studies with 361 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that rTMS significantly improved global cognitive function immediately following rTMS treatment [(MD) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-2.22, p < 0.00001, MMSE; 2.72, 95% CI, 1.77-3.67, p < 0.00001, ADAS-Cog], and the therapeutic effects persisted for an extended duration (2.20, 95% CI, 0.93-3.47, p =0.0007, MMSE; 1.96, 95% CI, 0.96-2.95, p = 0.0001, ADAS-Cog). Subgroup analyses showed that high frequency rTMS targeted to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for over 20 sessions induced the greatest cognitive improvement, with effects lasting for more than 1 month after the final treatment. There were no significant differences in dropout rate (p > 0.05) or adverse effect rate (p > 0.05) between the rTMS and control groups.Repetitive TMS is a potentially effective treatment for cognitive impairment in AD that is safe and can induce long-lasting effects.

In the first research scenario, the study of EVs isolated from neuronal models mimicking neurodegenerative diseases can open new avenues to better understand the pathological mechanisms underlying these conditions or to identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis and/or therapeutics. In the second research scenario, the easy availability of EVs in body fluids and the specificity of their cargo, which can reflect the cell of origin or disease profiles, turn these into attractive diagnostic tools. EVs with exosome-like characteristics, circulating in the bloodstream and other peripheral biofluids, constitute a non-invasive and rapid alternative to study several conditions, including brain-related disorders. In both cases, several EVs isolation methods are already available, but each neuronal model or biofluid presents its own challenges. Herein, a literature overview on EVs isolation methodologies from distinct neuronal models (cellular culture and brain tissue) and body fluids (serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and saliva) was carried out. Focus was given to approaches employed in the context of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and the main research findings discussed. The topics here revised will facilitate the choice of EVs isolation methodologies and potentially prompt new discoveries in EVs research and in the neurodegenerative diseases field.",

A population of neurons, termed engram cells, represents the physiological manifestation of a specific memory trace and is characterized by dynamic changes in gene expression, which in turn alters the synaptic connectivity and excitability of these cells. Recent applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) are promising approaches for delineating the dynamic expression profiles in these subsets of neurons, and thus understanding memory-specific genes, their combinatorial patterns and regulatory networks. The aim of this article is to review and discuss the experimental and computational procedures of sc/snRNA-seq, new studies of molecular mechanisms of memory aided by sc/snRNA-seq in human brain diseases and related mouse models, and computational challenges in understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying long-term memory formation.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Loss of Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) Protein in the Hippocampus and Temporal Cortex of a Subset of Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, or Frontotemporal Dementia: Implications for Patient Survival.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Dysfunction of cholinergic neurotransmission is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); forming the basis for using acetylcholine (ACh) esterase (AChE) inhibitors to mitigate symptoms of ACh deficiency in AD. The Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) is highly expressed in brain regions impaired by AD. Previous analyses of postmortem AD brains revealed unaltered CHRM1 mRNA expression compared to normal brains. However, the CHRM1 protein level in AD and other forms of dementia has not been extensively studied. Reduced expression of CHRM1 in AD patients may explain the limited clinical efficacy of AChE inhibitors.To quantify CHRM1 protein in the postmortem hippocampus and temporal cortex of AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients.Western blotting was performed on postmortem hippocampus (N\u200a=\u200a19/73/7/9: unaffected/AD/FTD/PD) and temporal cortex (N\u200a=\u200a9/74/27: unaffected/AD/PD) using a validated anti-CHRM1 antibody.Quantification based on immunoblotting using a validated anti-CHRM1 antibody revealed a significant loss of CHRM1 protein level (<50%) in the hippocampi (78% AD, 66% PD, and 85% FTD) and temporal cortices (56% AD and 42% PD) of dementia patients. Loss of CHRM1 in the temporal cortex was significantly associated with early death (<65-75 years) for both AD and PD patients.Severe reduction of CHRM1 in a subset of AD and PD patients can explain the reported low efficacy of AChE inhibitors as a mitigating treatment for dementia patients. Based on this study, it can be suggested that future research should prioritize therapeutic restoration of CHRM1 protein levels in cholinergic neurons.",

The Quality of Life in Alzheimer 's Disease (QoL-AD) questionnaire was used to assess health-related quality of life. A battery of self-report instruments was used to evaluate different psychological and behavioral domains. Associations between the QoL-AD and other outcome measures were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlations.A total of 149 patients were included. Mean age (SD) was 72.3 (7.0) years and mean disease duration was 1.4 (1.8) years. Mean MMSE score was 24.6 (2.1). The mean QoL-AD score was 37.9 (4.5). Eighty-three percent (n = 124) of patients had moderate-to-severe hopelessness, 22.1% (n = 33) had depressive symptoms, and 36.9% (n = 55) felt stigmatized. The quality of life showed a significant positive correlation with self-efficacy and negative correlations with depression, emotional and practical consequences, stigma, and hopelessness.Stigma, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness are frequent scenarios in AD negatively impacting quality of life, even in a population with short disease duration and minimal cognitive impairment.",

In order to enable a more timely detection of AD, research efforts are directed to identification of biomarkers of the early symptomatic stage. Neuroinflammatory signaling pathways and inflammation-related microRNAs (miRNAs) could possibly have a crucial role in AD, making them promising potential biomarkers.We examined the expression of circulatory miRNAs with a documented role in AD pathophysiology: miR-29a/b, miR-101, miR-125b, miR-146a, and miR-155 in the plasma of AD patients (AD, n\u200a=\u200a12), people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n\u200a=\u200a9), and normocognitive group (CTRL, n\u200a=\u200a18). We hypothesized that these miRNA expression levels could correlate with the level of participants' cognitive decline.The study participants completed the standardized interview, neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, and biochemical analyses. miRNA expression levels were assessed by RT-PCR.Neurological and laboratory findings could not account for MCI, but miR-146a and -155 were upregulated in the MCI group compared to the control. miR-146a, known to mediate early neuroinflammatory AD events, was also upregulated in the MCI compared to AD group. ROC curve analysis for miRNA-146a showed 77.8% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity and 66.7% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity for miR-155.Determination of circulatory inflamma-miRs-146a and -155 expression, together with neuropsychological screening, could become a non-invasive tool for detecting individuals with an increased risk for AD, but research on a larger cohort is warranted.",

The amyloid cascade hypothesis attributes a vital role to amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) in the pathogenesis of AD. As the main pathological hallmark of AD, amyloid plaques consist of merely the 42 and 40 amino acid variants of A\u03b2 (A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker A\u03b2 42/40 has been extensively investigated and eventually integrated into important diagnostic tools to support the clinical diagnosis of AD. With the development of highly sensitive assays and technologies, blood-based A\u03b2 42/40, which was obtained using a minimally invasive and cost-effective method, has been proven to be abnormal in synchrony with CSF biomarker values. This paper presents the recent progress of the CSF A\u03b2 42/40 ratio and plasma A\u03b2 42/40 for AD as well as their potential clinical application as diagnostic markers or screening tools for dementia.",

However, there in no investigations on the role of specific intracellular pathways to explain this connection. The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is one of the main regulators of cell survival which regulates cellular responses to environmental changes. This pathway also regulates the activity of platelets, and its aberrant activity has been linked to platelet dysfunction in different pathologies. On the other hand, the PI3K/AKT pathway regulates amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) production through regulation of amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP), BACE-1, ADAMs, and \u03b3-secretase. In addition, alterations in the activity of all of these factors in platelets has been shown in AD-related pathologies.

Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) can be associated with MCI (MCI-RBD).To investigate neuropsychological and brain metabolism features of patients with MCI-RBD by comparison with matched MCI-AD patients. To explore their predictive value toward conversion to a full-blown neurodegenerative disease.Seventeen MCI-RBD patients (73.6\u00b16.5 years) were enrolled. Thirty-four patients with MCI-AD were matched for age (74.8\u00b14.4 years), Mini-Mental State Exam score and education with a case-control criterion. All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment and brain 18F-FDG-PET. Images were compared between groups to identify hypometabolic volumes of interest (MCI-RBD-VOI and MCI-AD-VOI). The dependency of whole-brain scaled metabolism levels in MCI-RBD-VOI and MCI-AD-VOI on neuropsychological test scores was explored with linear regression analyses in both groups, adjusting for age and education. Survival analysis was performed to investigate VOIs phenoconversion prediction power.MCI-RBD group scored lower in executive functions and higher in verbal memory compared to MCI-AD group. Also, compared with MCI-AD, MCI-RBD group showed relative hypometabolism in a posterior brain area including cuneus, precuneus, and occipital regions while the inverse comparison revealed relative hypometabolism in the hippocampus/parahippocampal areas in MCI-AD group. MCI-RBD-VOI metabolism directly correlated with executive functions in MCI-RBD (p\u200a=\u200a0.04). MCI-AD-VOI metabolism directly correlated with verbal memory in MCI-AD (p\u200a=\u200a0.001).

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a global health challenge, with an estimated 55 million people suffering from the non-curable disease across the world. While amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain define AD proteinopathy, it has become evident that diverse coding and non-coding regions of the genome may significantly contribute to AD neurodegeneration. The diversity of factors associated with AD pathogenesis, coupled with age-associated damage, suggests that a series of triggering events may be required to initiate AD. Since somatic mutations accumulate with aging, and aging is a major risk factor for AD, there is a great potential for somatic mutational events to drive disease. Indeed, recent data from the Gozes team/laboratories as well as other leading laboratories correlated the accumulation of somatic brain mutations with the progression of tauopathy. In this review, we lay the current perspectives on the principal genetic factors associated with AD and the potential causes, highlighting the contribution of somatic mutations to the pathogenesis of late onset Alzheimer's disease. The roles that artificial intelligence and big data can play in accelerating the progress of causal somatic mutation markers/biomarkers identification, and the associated drug discovery/repurposing, have been highlighted for future AD and other neurodegenerative studies, with the aim to bring hope for the vulnerable aging population.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "This paper suggests a chemical mechanism for the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow stresses provide the energy needed to induce molecular conformation changes leading to AD by initiating amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau aggregation. Shear and extensional flow stresses initiate aggregation in the laboratory and in natural biophysical processes. Energy-rich CSF flow regions are mainly found in lower brain regions. MRI studies reveal flow stress \"hot spots\" in basal cisterns and brain ventricles that have chaotic flow properties that can distort molecules such as A\u03b2 and tau trapped in these regions into unusual conformations. Such fluid disturbance is surrounded by tissue deformation. There is strong mapping overlap between the locations of these hot spots and of early-stage AD pathology. Our mechanism creates pure and mixed protein dimers, followed by tissue surface adsorption, and long-term tissue agitation ultimately inducing chemical reactions forming more stable, toxic oligomer seeds that initiate AD. It is proposed that different flow stress energies and flow types in different basal brain regions produce different neurotoxic aggregates. Proliferating artery hardening is responsible for enhanced heart systolic pulses that drive energetic CSF pulses, whose critical maximum systolic pulse energy location migrates further from the heart with increasing vascular disease. Two glymphatic systems, carotid and basilar, are suggested to contain the earliest A\u03b2 and tau AD disease pathologies. A key to the proposed AD mechanism is a comparison of early chronic traumatic encephalopathy and AD pathologies. Experiments that test the proposed mechanism are needed.",

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been recognized as a promising approach for the treatment of aMCI.In this paper, we aimed to investigate the modulating mechanism of tDCS on the core neurocognitive networks of brain.We used repeated anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and assessed the effect on cognition and dynamic functional brain network in aMCI patients. We used a novel method called temporal variability to depict the characteristics of the dynamic brain functional networks.We found that true anodal stimulation significantly improved cognitive performance as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment after simulation. Meanwhile, the Mini-Mental State Examination scores showed a clear upward trend. More importantly, we found significantly altered temporal variability of dynamic functional connectivity of regions belonging to the default mode network, central executive network, and the salience network after true anodal stimulation, indicating anodal HD-tDCS may enhance brain function by modulating the temporal variability of the brain regions.These results imply that ten days of anodal repeated HD-tDCS over the LDLPFC exerts beneficial effects on the temporal variability of the functional architecture of the brain, which may be a potential neural mechanism by which HD-tDCS enhances brain functions. Repeated HD-tDCS may have clinical uses for the intervention of brain function decline in aMCI patients.",

According to the visualization and test results, doctors can easily select the final rules after analysis and trade-off. Our framework is verified on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n\u200a=\u200a606) and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) dataset (n\u200a=\u200a375).The predictive or diagnostic rules learned by RRL offer a better trade-off between accuracy and model interpretability than other representative machine learning models. For mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction, the cognitive-test-based rules achieve an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.904 on ADNI. For dementia diagnosis on subjects with a normal Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score, the learned rules achieve an AUC of 0.863 on PUMCH.

Using mediation models, we evaluated the mediation role of parents' educational level, reading time (RT), and physical activity time (PAT) in the years of education (IYE) and cognitive performance.People who reported having lived in an urban area during their childhood are estimated to have, on average, 2.085 years more formal education than those who lived in rural areas. In addition, 49% of cognitive performance scores are explained by the mediation effect of reading and physical activity time in the IYE. This implies that higher levels of education, mediated by RT and PAT per week, are 1.596 units associated with higher scores on the ACE-R.Despite the fact that nonmodifiable factors (i.e., childhood residence area, parents' educational level) seem to exert an effect on older adults' cognition, their influence is mediated by other factors that are indeed modifiable (i.e., reading time, physical activity engagement).

We have previously shown that the microbially-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with cognitive impairment due to AD and positively correlates with increases in CSF biomarkers for tangle, plaque, and neuronal pathology.We assessed the direct impact of TMAO on AD progression.To do so, transgenic 5XFAD mice were supplemented with TMAO for 12 weeks. Neurite density was assessed through quantitative brain microstructure imaging with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Label-free, quantitative proteomics was performed on cortex lysates from TMAO-treated and untreated animals. Amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, astrocytes, and microglia were assessed by fluorescent immunohistochemistry and synaptic protein expression was quantified via western blot.Oral TMAO administration resulted in significantly reduced neurite density in several regions of the brain. Amyloid-\u03b2 plaque mean intensity was reduced, while plaque count and size remained unaltered. Proteomics analysis revealed that TMAO treatment impacted the expression of 30 proteins (1.5-fold cut-off) in 5XFAD mice, including proteins known to influence neuronal health and amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein processing. TMAO treatment did not alter astrocyte and microglial response nor cortical synaptic protein expression.These data suggest that elevated plasma TMAO impacts AD pathology via reductions in neurite density.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Although elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, the relevance of Hcy, vitamin B12, and folate levels to subtypes of dementia are still unknown.To investigate the changes of Hcy, vitamin B12, and folate levels in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subtypes of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Lewy body dementia (LBD), and their relationships with cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers.We measured serum levels of Hcy, vitamin B12, and folate in 257 subjects. Each subject underwent cognitive function assessment and brain MRI test. The Fazekas and temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) visual rating scales were used to assess the degree of white matter hyperintensities and MTA, respectively.Serum levels of Hcy was higher and vitamin B12 was lower in AD, VaD, FTD, and LBD groups than cognitively normal controls. No significant differences of folate levels were found among 6 groups. Hcy levels were positively correlated with MTA total score in AD (r\u200a=\u200a0.448, p\u200a<\u200a0.001). Vitamin B12 levels were positively correlated with MoCA in VaD (r\u200a=\u200a0.497), and negatively correlated with MTA total score in AD (r\u200a=\u200a- 0.325) (ps\u200a<\u200a0.05). Hyperhomocysteinemia may increase the risk of AD (OR\u200a=\u200a2.744), VaD (OR\u200a=\u200a3.600), and FTD (OR\u200a=\u200a3.244) in the adjusted model (ps\u200a<\u200a0.05).Hcy and vitamin B12 levels are associated with MTA in AD. Vitamin B12 levels are associated with general cognition in VaD. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for not only AD and VaD but also FTD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has relied on mouse models overexpressing human mutant A \u03b2PP; however, newer generation knock-in models allow for physiological expression of amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP) containing familial AD mutations where murine A\u03b2PP is edited with a humanized amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) sequence. The AppNL-F mouse model has shown substantial similarities to AD brains developing late onset cognitive impairment.In this study, we aimed to characterize mature primary cortical neurons derived from homozygous AppNL-F embryos, especially to identify early mitochondrial alterations in this model.Primary cultures of AppNL-F neurons kept in culture for 12-15 days were used to measure A\u03b2 levels, secretase activity, mitochondrial functions, mitochondrial-ER contacts, synaptic function, and cell death.We detected higher levels of A\u03b242 released from AppNL-F neurons as compared to wild-type neurons. AppNL-F neurons, also displayed an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio, similar to adult AppNL-F mouse brain. Interestingly, we found an upregulation in mitochondrial oxygen consumption with concomitant downregulation in glycolytic reserve. Furthermore, AppNL-F neurons were more susceptible to cell death triggered by mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition. Juxtaposition between ER and mitochondria was found to be substantially upregulated, which may account for upregulated mitochondrial-derived ATP production. However, anterograde mitochondrial movement was severely impaired in this model along with loss in synaptic vesicle protein and impairment in pre- and post-synaptic function.We show that widespread mitochondrial alterations can be detected in AppNL-F neurons in vitro, where amyloid plaque deposition does not occur, suggesting soluble and oligomeric A\u03b2-species being responsible for these alterations.",

It is presumed to involve different pathophysiological mechanisms and neuroanatomical regions.We explored the hypothesis that subgroups showing distinct profiles of apathy and distinct patterns of atrophy within frontal lobes could be disentangled in bvFTD.Using data-driven clustering applied to 20 bvFTD patients, we isolated subgroups according to their profiles on the three subscales of the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS). We explored their apathy profiles and atrophy patterns. Apathy profiles were characterized through both subjective measures of apathy by questionnaires and measures including objective behavioral metrics. Atrophy patterns were obtained by voxel-based morphometry, contrasting each bvFTD subgroup with healthy controls (N\u200a=\u200a16).By clustering based on DAS dimensions, we disentangled three subgroups of bvFTD patients, with distinct apathy profiles and atrophy patterns. One subgroup, which presented the smallest pattern of atrophy (including orbitofrontal cortex) with a right asymmetry, was characterized by high self-reported emotional and initiation apathy and by a self-initiation deficit reversible by external guidance. In other subgroups showing more diffuse bilateral atrophies extending to lateral prefrontal cortex, apathy was not reversible by external guidance and more difficulty to focus on goal-management was observed, especially in the subgroup with the largest atrophy and highest levels of executive apathy.Distinct clinical profiles of apathy, corresponding to distinct anatomical subtypes of bvFTD, were identified. These findings have implications for clinicians in a perspective of precision medicine as they could contribute to personalize treatments of apathy.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Susceptibility to proactive semantic interference (PSI) and the inability to ameliorate these difficulties with one additional learning trial have repeatedly been implicated as early features of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unfortunately, persistent failure to recover from PSI (frPSI) after repeated learning trials, are not captured by existing memory measures, or been examined in pre-mild cognitive impairment (PreMCI).A novel Cognitive Stress Test (CST) was employed to measure the impact of PSI, initial failure to recover from PSI and persistent effects of PSI, despite multiple learning trials of the new to-be-remembered material (pfrPSI). We hypothesized that PSI deficits on the CST would persist in both PreMCI and amnestic MCI (aMCI) groups over repeated learning trials when compared to cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults.One hundred fifty older adults (69 CU, 31 PreMCI, and 50 aMCI) underwent a standardized clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. The CST was independent of diagnostic classification.Even after adjusting for strength of initial learning, aMCI and PreMCI groups demonstrated greater persistent PSI (pfrPSI) relative to the CU group despite repeated learning trials of List B. Further, the aMCI group made a higher number of semantic intrusion errors relative to the PreMCI and CU groups on all List B Cued Recall trials.Persistent PSI appears to be a common feature of aMCI and PreMCI. The possible theoretical mechanisms and empirical implications of these new findings are discussed.",

Resistance training (RT) is a promising intervention to reduce WMH progression, improve executive functions, and reduce falls. However, the underlying neurobiological process by which RT improves executive functions and falls risk remain unclear. We hypothesized that: 1) RT reduces the level of WMH-related disruption to functional networks; and 2) reduced disruption to the sensorimotor and attention networks will be associated with improved executive function and reduced falls risk.Investigate the impact of 52 weeks of RT on WMH-related disruption to functional networks.Thirty-two older females (65-75 years) were included in this exploratory analysis of a 52-week randomized controlled trial. Participants received either twice-weekly RT or balance and tone training (control). We used lesion network mapping to assess changes in WMH-related disruption to the sensorimotor, dorsal attention, and ventral attention networks. Executive function was measured using the Stroop Colour-Word Test. Falls risk was assessed using the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) and the foam sway test.RT significantly reduced the level of WMH-related disruption to the sensorimotor network (p\u200a=\u200a0.005). Reduced disruption to the dorsal attention network was associated with improvements in Stroop performance (r\u200a=\u200a0.527, p\u200a=\u200a0.030).

These can often co-occur with depression and anxiety as common and detrimental comorbidities among the growing population living with chronic conditions. Digital health interventions (DHIs) hold promise in overcoming barriers to accessing mental health support for these individuals; however, the design and implementation of DHIs for depression and anxiety in people with chronic conditions are yet to be explored.This study aimed to explore what is known in the literature regarding DHIs for the prevention, detection, or treatment of depression and anxiety among people with chronic conditions.A scoping review of the literature was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Searches of the literature published in 5 databases between 1990 and 2019 were conducted in April 2019 and updated in March 2021. To be included, studies must have described a DHI tested with, or designed for, the prevention, detection, or treatment of depression or anxiety in people with common chronic conditions (arthritis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer disease or dementia). Studies were independently screened by 2 reviewers against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Both quantitative and qualitative data were extracted, charted, and synthesized to provide a descriptive summary of the trends and considerations for future research.Database searches yielded 11,422 articles across the initial and updated searches, 53 (0.46%) of which were included in this review. DHIs predominantly sought to provide treatment (44/53, 83%), followed by detection (5/53, 9%) and prevention (4/53, 8%). Most DHIs were focused on depression (36/53, 68%), guided (32/53, 60%), tailored to chronic physical conditions (19/53, 36%), and delivered through web-based platforms (20/53, 38%). Only 2 studies described the implementation of a DHI.As a growing research area, DHIs offer the potential to address the gap in care for depression and anxiety among people with chronic conditions; however, their implementation in standard care is scarce. Although stepped care has been identified as a promising model to implement efficacious DHIs, few studies have investigated the use of DHIs for depression and anxiety among chronic conditions using such models. In developing stepped care, we outlined DHI tailoring, guidance, and intensity as key considerations that require further research.",

The promising diagnostic potential of serum miRNAs is increasingly emerging; however, rare miRNAs data originates from middle and low-income countries to provide proper validation in these highly affected populations. This study evaluated the diagnostic value of serum miR-34a, miR-29b and miR-181c in Egyptian AD patients.Expression levels of serum miR-34a, miR-29b and miR-181c were determined using quantitative real time PCR in AD patients versus healthy controls. Amyloid Beta 42 (A\u03b242), Phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) and TNF-\u03b1 levels were also detected as distinctive AD markers. We further explored the correlation between miRNAs levels and Mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores. Finally, we conducted logistic regression and ROC curve analyses to evaluate the diagnostic values of the measured parameters.Sera miR-34a, miR-29b and miR-181c were significantly downregulated in AD patients and this decrease was associated with cognitive decline. AD patients manifested significant elevation of A\u03b242, pTau and TNF-\u03b1 levels.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), a neuronal lesion found in Alzheimer's disease (AD), are composed of fibrillary aggregates of modified forms of tau proteins. The propagation of NFT follows neuroanatomical pathways suggesting that synaptically connected neurons could transmit tau pathology by the recruitment of normal tau in a prion-like manner. Moreover, the intracerebral injection of pathological tau from AD brains induces the seeding of normal tau in mouse brain. Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease has been transmitted after ocular transplants of cornea or sclera and the scrapie agent can spread across the retino-tectal pathway after intraocular injection of scrapie mouse brain homogenates. In AD, a tau pathology has been detected in the retina. To investigate the potential risk of tau pathology transmission during eye surgery using AD tissue material, we have analysed the development of tau pathology in the visual pathway of mice models expressing murine tau, wild-type or mutant human tau after intraocular injection of pathological tau proteins from AD brains. Although these pathological tau proteins were internalized in retinal ganglion cells, they did not induce aggregation of endogenous tau nor propagation of a tau pathology in the retino-tectal pathway after a 6-month incubation period. These results suggest that retinal ganglion cells exhibit a resistance to develop a tau pathology, and that eye surgery is not a major iatrogenic risk of transmission of tau pathology, contrary to what has been observed for transmission of infectious prions in prion diseases.",

Xylitol is a functional sugar alcohol, which has been reported to regulate glucose metabolism.The present study was designed to determine whether xylitol can alleviate cognitive impairment in AD mice.In the current research, 5% xylitol was supplemented in diet to treat APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice for 2 months. Cognitive ability was measured by Morris water maze, anxiety-like behaviors was examined by open-field experiment. Hippocampal cellular apoptosis and mitochondria pathway related apoptotic proteins were tested by TUNEL staining and immunoblotting, respectively. By LC-MS, plasma levels of glucose metabolism intermediates and related amino acids were evaluated.Results showed that xylitol could significantly ameliorate the anxiety-like activity in AD mice, by at least partially regulating expression levels of mitochondrial pathway related apoptotic proteins. The participation of xylitol regulated glucose metabolism may play the important role in the process.The current study suggests that xylitol may be a potential candidate for improving neuropsychiatric behavior in AD by regulating the levels of TCA cycle intermediates and related amino acids in glucose metabolism.",

This systematic review synthesized the evidence for an association between epigenetic aging and dementia, mild cognitive impairment and cognitive function. Methods: A systematic search was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: 30\u00a0eligible articles were included. There was no strong evidence that accelerated epigenetic aging was associated with dementia/mild cognitive impairment (n\u00a0=\u00a07). There was some evidence of an association with poorer cognition (n\u00a0=\u00a020), particularly with GrimAge acceleration, but this was inconsistent and varied across cognitive domains. A meta-analysis was not performed due to high study heterogeneity. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to indicate that current epigenetic aging clocks can be clinically useful biomarkers of dementia or cognitive aging.As individuals get older, changes in cognitive performance are common, including some degree of cognitive decline. Dementia is a symptom characterized by significant decline in cognitive function that affects daily living, and age is the biggest risk factor. Researchers have now identified ways to estimate a person's biological age from a blood sample (referred to as \u2018epigenetic aging\u2019), and this measure is thought to better estimate an individual's rate of aging than his or her chronological age. This study brought together all of the previous studies, 30 in total, that have investigated links between biological aging and cognitive performance, as well as dementia risk. Synthesizing all of this evidence, the authors found no strong evidence that the individuals with dementia had accelerated aging. However, there was some evidence, although inconsistent, indicating that accelerated aging was associated with worse cognitive performance.",

Hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and other non-covalent interactions as \u03c0-stacking were investigated. Parallel aggregation was slightly preferred due to its adaptability, but antiparallel aggregation remained widely present during the PHF6 aggregation. The analysis highlighted the leading role of hydrogen bonds identified at the atomic level for each aggregation process. The aggregation study emphasized the importance of Tyr310 during the \u03b2-sheets' complexation through \u03c0-stacking.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to the misfolding and aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein, and its major pathological hallmark is fibrillary \u03b2-amyloid plaques. Impeding the formation of A\u03b2 \u03b2-structure-rich aggregates and dissociating A\u03b2 fibrils are considered potent strategies to suppress the onset and progression of AD. As a molecular chaperone, human \u03b1B-crystallin has received extensive attention in the inhibition of protein aggregation. Previous experiments reported that the structured core region of \u03b1B-crystallin (\u03b1BC) exhibits a better preventive effect on A\u03b2 aggregation and toxicity than the full-length protein. However, the molecular mechanism behind the effect of inhibition remains mostly unknown. Herein, we carried out six 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of \u03b1BC on A\u03b242 aggregation. Our simulations show that \u03b1BC greatly impedes the formation of \u03b2-structure contents. We find that the binding of \u03b1BC to the A\u03b242 monomer is driven by polar, hydrophobic, and H-bonding interactions. To explore whether \u03b1BC could destabilize A\u03b242 protofibrils, we also carried out MD simulations of A\u03b242 protofibrils with and without \u03b1BC. The results show that \u03b1BC interacts with three binding sites of the A\u03b242 protofibril, and the binding is mainly driven by polar and H-bonding interactions. The binding of \u03b1BC at these three sites has a preferred dissociation effect on the \u03b2-structure content, kink angle, and K28-A42 salt bridges. Overall, this study not only discloses the molecular mechanism of \u03b1BC against A\u03b242 aggregation but also demonstrates the disruption effects of \u03b1BC on A\u03b242 protofibrils, which yields an avenue for designing anti-AD drug candidates.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Higher levels of myelin are associated with higher resistance against tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), fibrillar tau initially occurs locally and progresses preferentially between closely connected regions. However, the underlying sources of regional vulnerability to tau pathology remain unclear. Previous brain-autopsy findings suggest that the myelin levels-which differ substantially between white matter tracts in the brain-are a key modulating factor of region-specific susceptibility to tau deposition. Here, we investigated whether myelination differences between fiber tracts of the human connectome are predictive of the interregional spreading of tau pathology in AD.We included two independently recruited samples consisting of amyloid-PET-positive asymptomatic and symptomatic elderly individuals, in whom tau-PET was obtained at baseline (ADNI: n\u2009=\u2009275; BioFINDER-1: n\u2009=\u2009102) and longitudinally in a subset (ADNI: n\u2009=\u2009123, mean FU\u2009=\u20091.53 [0.69-3.95] years; BioFINDER-1: n\u2009=\u200939, mean FU\u2009=\u20091.87 [1.21-2.78] years). We constructed MRI templates of the myelin water fraction (MWF) in 200\u00a0gray matter ROIs and connecting fiber tracts obtained from adult cognitively normal participants. Using the same 200 ROI brain-parcellation atlas, we obtained tau-PET ROI values from each individual in ADNI and BioFINDER-1. In\u00a0a spatial regression analysis, we first tested the association between cortical myelin and group-average tau-PET signal in the amyloid-positive and control groups. Secondly, employing a previously established approach of modeling tau-PET spreading based on functional connectivity between ROIs, we estimated in\u00a0a linear regression analysis, whether the level of fiber-tract myelin modulates the association between functional connectivity and longitudinal tau-PET spreading (i.e., covariance) between ROIs.We found that higher myelinated cortical regions show lower tau-PET uptake (ADNI: rho\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.267, p\u2009<\u20090.001; BioFINDER-1: rho\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.175, p\u2009=\u20090.013). Fiber-tract myelin levels modulated the association between functional connectivity and tau-PET spreading, such that at higher levels of fiber-tract myelin, the association between stronger connectivity and higher covariance of tau-PET between the connected ROIs was attenuated (interaction fiber-tract myelin\u2009\u00d7\u2009functional connectivity: ADNI: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.185, p\u2009<\u20090.001; BioFINDER-1: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.166, p\u2009<\u20090.001).Higher levels of myelin are associated with lower susceptibility of the connected regions to accumulate fibrillar tau. These results enhance our understanding of brain substrates that explain regional variation in tau accumulation and encourage future studies to investigate potential underlying mechanisms.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "ApoE is the major lipid and cholesterol carrier in the CNS. There are three major human polymorphisms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, and the genetic expression of APOE4 is one of the most influential risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation has become the third hallmark of AD, together with Amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated aggregated tau protein. This review aims to broadly and extensively describe the differential aspects concerning apoE. Starting from the evolution of apoE to how APOE's single-nucleotide polymorphisms affect its structure, function, and involvement during health and disease. This review reflects on how APOE's polymorphisms impact critical aspects of AD pathology, such as the neuroinflammatory response, particularly the effect of APOE on astrocytic and microglial function and microglial dynamics, synaptic function, amyloid-\u03b2 load, tau pathology, autophagy, and cell-cell communication. We discuss influential factors affecting AD pathology combined with the APOE genotype, such as sex, age, diet, physical exercise, current therapies and clinical trials in the AD field. The impact of the APOE genotype in other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overt inflammation, e.g., alpha- synucleinopathies and Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, is also addressed. Therefore, this review gathers the most relevant findings related to the APOE genotype up to date and its implications on AD and CNS pathologies to provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge in the APOE field.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Research in recent years firmly established that microglial cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In parallel, a series of studies showed that, under both homeostatic and pathological conditions, microglia are a heterogeneous cell population. In AD, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaque-associated microglia (PAM) display a clearly distinct phenotype compared to plaque-distant microglia (PCM), suggesting that these two microglia subtypes likely differently contribute to disease progression. So far, molecular characterization of PAM was performed indirectly using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches or based on markers that are supposedly up-regulated in this microglia subpopulation.In this study based on a well-characterized AD mouse model, we combined cell-specific laser capture\u00a0microdissection and RNA-seq analysis to i) identify, without preconceived notions of the molecular and/or functional changes that would affect these cells, the genes and gene networks that are dysregulated in PAM or PCM at three critical stages of the disease, and ii) to investigate the potential contribution of both plaque-associated and plaque-distant microglia.First, we established that our approach allows selective isolation of microglia, while preserving spatial information and preventing transcriptome changes induced by classical purification approaches. Then, we identified, in PAM and PCM subpopulations, networks of co-deregulated genes and analyzed their potential functional roles in AD. Finally, we investigated the dynamics of microglia transcriptomic remodeling at early, intermediate and late stages of the disease\u00a0and validated select findings in postmortem human AD brain.Our comprehensive study provides useful transcriptomic information regarding the respective contribution of PAM and PCM across the A\u03b2 pathology progression. It highlights specific pathways that would require further study to decipher their roles across disease\u00a0progression. It demonstrates that the proximity of microglia to A\u03b2-plaques dramatically alters the microglial transcriptome and reveals that these changes can have both positive and negative impacts on the surrounding cells. These opposing effects may be driven by local microglia heterogeneity also demonstrated by this study. Our approach leads to molecularly define the less well studied plaque-distant microglia. We show that plaque-distant microglia are not bystanders of the disease, although the transcriptomic changes are far less striking compared to what is observed in plaque-associated microglia. In particular, our results suggest they may be involved in A\u03b2 oligomer detection and in A\u03b2-plaque initiation, with increased contribution as the disease progresses.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that eventually affects memory and behavior. The identification of biomarkers based on risk factors for AD provides insight into the disease since the exact cause of AD remains unknown. Several studies have proposed microRNAs (miRNAs) in blood as potential biomarkers for AD. Exposure to heavy metals is a potential risk factor for onset and development of AD. Blood cells of subjects that are exposed to lead detected in the circulatory system, potentially reflect molecular responses to this exposure that are similar to the response of neurons. In this study we analyzed blood cell-derived miRNAs derived from a general population as proxies of potentially AD-related mechanisms triggered by lead exposure. Subsequently, we analyzed these mechanisms in the brain tissue of AD subjects and controls. A total of four miRNAs were identified as lead exposure-associated with hsa-miR-3651, hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-664b-3p being negatively and hsa-miR-627 positively associated. In human brain derived from AD and AD control subjects all four miRNAs were detected. Moreover, two miRNAs (miR-3651, miR-664b-3p) showed significant differential expression in AD brains versus controls, in accordance with the change direction of lead exposure. The miRNAs' gene targets were validated for expression in the human brain and were found enriched in AD-relevant pathways such as axon guidance. Moreover, we identified several AD relevant transcription factors such as CREB1 associated with the identified miRNAs. These findings suggest that the identified miRNAs are involved in the development of AD and might be useful in the development of new, less invasive biomarkers for monitoring of novel therapies or of processes involved in AD development.",

Recently, epigenetic alterations, particularly miRNA, have gotten attention in AD research. Among various miRNA, miR-34c has been addressed to be elevated in the brain of AD patients, however, its exact role and downstream mechanisms have not been elucidated yet. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of miR-34c antagomir on cognitive dysfunction induced by streptozocin (STZ), considering postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and mammalian target of rapamycin expression (mTOR). Forty rats were cannulated intraventricularly under deep anesthesia using stereotaxic apparatus and divided into five groups: saline\u00a0+\u00a0saline, STZ\u00a0+\u00a0saline, STZ\u00a0+\u00a0miR-34c antagomir, STZ\u00a0+\u00a0lipofectamine, and STZ\u00a0+\u00a0scrambled, and received the related treatments for two weeks. At the end of the treatments, spatial memory and locomotor activity were assessed by Morris water maze (MWM), and open fields, respectively. Finally, PSD-95 and mTOR levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blotting on hippocampal samples. Results showed that miR-34c antagomir markedly ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficits induced by STZ, and significantly enhanced PSD-95 and mTOR levels in the hippocampus. In conclusion, miR-34c antagomir may be considered as a promising novel therapeutic target for AD patients.",

Although its importance for the proper development and function of the brain and its role as a switch between neuronal survival and death are unmistakable and unquestionable, Cdk5 is nevertheless increasingly emerging, as supported by a large number of publications on the subject, as a therapeutic target of choice in the fight against Alzheimer's disease. Thus, its aberrant over activation via the calpain-dependent conversion of p35 into p25 is observed during the pathogenesis of the disease where it leads to the hyperphosphorylation of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein and tau. The present review highlights the pivotal roles of the hyperactive Cdk5-p25 complex activity in contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, with a particular emphasis on the linking function between A\u03b2 and tau that this kinase fulfils and on the fact that Cdk5-p25 is part of a deleterious feed forward loop giving rise to a molecular machinery runaway leading to AD pathogenesis. Additionally, we discuss the advances and challenges related to the possible strategies aimed at specifically inhibiting Cdk5-p25 activity and which could lead to promising anti-AD therapeutics.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "To determine the characteristics of participants with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in a trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD).142 DIAD mutation carriers received either gantenerumab SC (n\u00a0=\u00a052), solanezumab IV (n\u00a0=\u00a050), or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a040). Participants underwent assessments with the Clinical Dementia Rating\u00ae (CDR\u00ae), neuropsychological testing, CSF biomarkers, \u03b2-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor ARIA. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated potential ARIA-related risk factors.Eleven participants developed ARIA-E, including 3 with mild symptoms. No ARIA-E was reported under solanezumab while gantenerumab was associated with ARIA-E compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a09.1, confidence interval [CI][1.2, 412.3]; p\u00a0=\u20090.021). Under gantenerumab, APOE-\u025b4 carriers were more likely to develop ARIA-E (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.0, CI[1.0, 30.4]; p\u00a0=\u20090.055), as were individuals with microhemorrhage at baseline (OR\u00a0=\u00a013.7, CI[1.2, 163.2]; p\u00a0=\u20090.039). No ARIA-E was observed at the initial 225\u2009mg/month gantenerumab dose, and most cases were observed at doses >675\u2009mg. At first ARIA-E occurrence, all ARIA-E participants were amyloid-PET+, 60% were CDR\u2009>0, 60% were past their estimated year to symptom onset, and 60% had also incident ARIA-H. Most ARIA-E radiologically resolved after dose adjustment and developing ARIA-E did not significantly increase odds of trial discontinuation. ARIA-E was more frequently observed in the occipital lobe (90%). ARIA-E severity was associated with age at time of ARIA-E.In DIAD, solanezumab was not associated with ARIA. Gantenerumab dose over 225\u2009mg increased ARIA-E risk, with additional risk for individuals APOE-\u025b4(+) or with microhemorrhage. ARIA-E was reversible on MRI in most cases, generally asymptomatic, without additional risk for trial discontinuation. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:729-744.",

Amyloid accumulation is an early pathological AD event, but the genetic association with known AD risk variants beyond the APOE4 effect is largely unknown. We investigated the association between different AD polygenic risk scores (PRS) and amyloid accumulation in the Flemish Prevent AD Cohort KU Leuven (F-PACK).We calculated PRS with and without the APOE region in 90 cognitively healthy F-PACK participants (baseline age 67.8 (52-80) years, 41 APOE4 carriers), with baseline and follow-up amyloid-PET (time interval 6.1 (3.4-10.9) years). Individuals were genotyped using Illumina GSA and imputed. PRS were calculated using three p-value thresholds (pT) for variant inclusion: 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8, 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5, and 0.1, based on the stage 1 summary statistics from Kunkle et al.

Linear regression models determined if these PRS predicted amyloid accumulation.A score based on PRS excluding the APOE region at pT\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8 plus the weighted sum of the two major APOE variants (rs429358 and rs7412) was significantly associated with amyloid accumulation (p\u2009=\u20090.0126). The two major APOE variants were also significantly associated with amyloid accumulation (p\u2009=\u20090.0496). The other PRS were not significant.Specific PRS are associated with amyloid accumulation in the asymptomatic phase of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves pathological processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-\u03b2 and microtubule associated protein Tau (MAPT) into hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles leading to neurodegeneration. Only 5% of AD cases are familial making it difficult to predict who will develop the disease thereby hindering our ability to treat the causes of the disease. A large population who almost certainly will, are those with Down syndrome (DS), who have a 90% lifetime incidence of AD. DS is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 resulting in three copies of APP and other AD-associated genes, like dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) overexpression. This implies that DYRK1a inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for DS and AD, however It is not clear how overexpression of each of these genes contributes to the pathology of each disease as well as how effective a DYRK1A inhibitor would be at suppressing any of these. To address this knowledge gap, we used Drosophila models with human Tau, human amyloid-\u03b2 or fly DYRK1A (minibrain (mnb)) neuronal overexpression resulting in photoreceptor neuron degeneration, premature death, decreased locomotion, sleep and memory loss. DYRK1A small molecule Type 1 kinase inhibitors (DYR219 and DYR533) were effective at suppressing these disease relevant phenotypes confirming their therapeutic potential.",

Using individual items from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and k-modes cluster analysis, we previously identified three clusters of individuals without overt cognitive impairment: (1) High Performing (no deficits in performance), (2) Memory Deficits (lower memory performance), and (3) Compound Deficits (lower memory and executive function performance). In this study, we sought to understand the relationships found in our clusters between cortical atrophy on MR and amyloid burden on PET.Data were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and comprised individuals from our previous analyses with available MR and amyloid PET scans (n\u00a0=\u00a0272). Using multiple-group structural equation modeling, we regressed amyloid standardized uptake value ratio on volumetric regions to simultaneously evaluate unique associations within each cluster.In our Compound Deficits cluster, greater whole cerebral amyloid burden was significantly related to right entorhinal cortical and left hippocampal atrophy, rs \u00a0=\u00a0-.412 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.005) and -.304 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.049), respectively. Within this cluster, right entorhinal cortical atrophy was significantly related to greater amyloid burden within multiple frontal regions.The Compound Deficits cluster, which represents a group potentially at higher risk for decline, was observed to have significantly more cortical atrophy, particularly within the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, associated with whole brain and frontal lobe amyloid burden. These findings point to a pattern of early pathological deterioration that may place these individuals at risk for future decline.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations of the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) are known to lead to early onset and more aggressive Alzheimer's disease. FAD mutations such as \"Iowa\" (D23N), \"Arctic\" (E22G), \"Italian\" (E22K), and \"Dutch\" (E22Q) have been shown to accelerate A\u03b2 aggregation relative to the wild-type (WT). The mechanism by which these mutations facilitate increased aggregation is unknown, but each mutation results in a change in the net charge of the peptide. Previous studies have used nonpolarizable force fields to study A\u03b2, providing some insight into how this protein unfolds. However, nonpolarizable force fields have fixed charges that lack the ability to redistribute in response to changes in local electric fields. Here, we performed polarizable molecular dynamics simulations on the full-length A\u03b242 of WT and FAD mutations and calculated folding free energies of the A\u03b215-27 fragment via umbrella sampling. By studying both the full-length A\u03b242 and a fragment containing mutations and the central hydrophobic cluster (residues 17-21), we were able to systematically study how these FAD mutations impact secondary and tertiary structure and the thermodynamics of folding. Electrostatic interactions, including those between permanent and induced dipoles, affected side-chain properties, salt bridges, and solvent interactions. The FAD mutations resulted in shifts in the electronic structure and solvent accessibility at the central hydrophobic cluster and the hydrophobic C-terminal region. Using umbrella sampling, we found that the folding of the WT and E22 mutants is enthalpically driven, whereas the D23N mutant is entropically driven, arising from a different unfolding pathway and peptide-bond dipole response. Together, the unbiased, full-length, and umbrella sampling simulations of fragments reveal that the FAD mutations perturb nearby residues and others in hydrophobic regions to potentially alter solubility. These results highlight the role electronic polarizability plays in amyloid misfolding and the role of heterogeneous microenvironments that arise as conformational change takes place.",

This crippling disorder is becoming more prevalent at an unprecedented rate, which has led to an increase in the financial cost of caring. It is a pathologically complicated, multifactorial disease characterized by \u03b2-amyloid precipitation, \u03b2-amyloid oligomer production, decrease in cholinergic function, and dysregulation of other neurotransmitter systems. Due to the pathogenic complexity of AD, multitarget drugs that can simultaneously alternate multiple biological targets may enhance the therapeutic efficacy. Donepezil (DNP) is the most potent approved drug for the treatment of AD. It has a remarkable effect on a number of AD-related processes, including cholinesterase activity, anti-A\u03b2 aggregation, oxidative stress, and more. DNP resembles an excellent scaffold to be hybridized with other pharmacophoric moieties having biological activity against AD pathological factors. There have been significant attempts made to modify the structure of DNP to create new bioactive chemical entities with novel structural patterns. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the development of multiple-target DNP-hybridized models for the treatment of AD that can be used in the future in the rational design of new potential AD therapeutics. The design and development of new drug candidates for the treatment of AD using DNP as a molecular scaffold have also been reviewed and summarized.",

A proposed therapeutic strategy to avoid the aggregation of A\u03b2 into higher-order structures is to develop molecules that inhibit the early stages of aggregation, i.e., dimerization. Under physiological conditions, the A\u03b2 dimer is highly dynamic and does not attain a single well-defined structure but is rather characterized by an ensemble of conformations. In a recent study, a highly heterogeneous library of conformers of the A\u03b2 dimer was generated by an efficient sampling method with constraints based on ion mobility mass spectrometry data. Here, we make use of the A\u03b2 dimer library to study the interaction with two curcumin degradation products, ferulic aldehyde and vanillin, by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Ensemble docking and MD simulations are used to provide atomistic detail of the interactions between the curcumin degradation products and the A\u03b2 dimer. The simulations show that the aromatic residues of A\u03b2, and in particular 19FF20, interact with ferulic aldehyde and vanillin through \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking.

        "ArticleAbstract": "The effect of a ketogenic diet (KD) on middle aged female mice is poorly understood as most of this work have been conducted in young female mice or diseased models. We have previously shown that an isocaloric KD started at middle age in male mice results in enhanced mitochondrial mass and function after 2\u00a0months on diet and improved cognitive behavior after being on diet for 14\u2009months when compared with their control diet (CD) fed counterparts. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of an isocaloric 2-month KD or CD on healthy 14-month-old female mice. At 16\u2009months of age cognitive behavior tests were performed and then serum, skeletal muscle, cortex, and hippocampal tissues were collected for biochemical analysis. Two months on a KD resulted in enhanced cognitive behavior associated with anxiety, memory, and willingness to explore. The improved neurocognitive function was associated with increased PGC1\u03b1 protein in the gastrocnemius (GTN) muscle and nuclear fraction. The KD resulted in a tissue specific increase in mitochondrial mass and kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) levels in the GTN and soleus muscles, with a corresponding decrease in kynurenine and increase in kynurenic acid levels in serum. With KAT proteins being responsible for converting kynurenine into kynurenic acid, which is unable to cross the blood brain barrier and be turned into quinolinic acid-a potent neurotoxin, this study provides a potential mechanism of crosstalk between muscle and brain in mice on a KD that may contribute to improved cognitive function in middle-aged female mice.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and behavioral impairment. Curcumin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-CCM) can overcome the drawbacks related to the free curcumin (CCM) clinical application, such as water insolubility and low bioavailability, besides acting over the main causes associated to AD. A thermo-responsive hydrogel is an interesting approach for facilitating the administration of the nanosystem via a nasal route, as well as for overcoming mucociliary clearance mechanisms. In light of this, MSN-CCM were dispersed in the hydrogel and evaluated through in vitro and in vivo assays. The MSNs and MSN-CCM were successfully characterized by physicochemical analysis and a high value of the CCM encapsulation efficiency (EE%, 87.70 \u00b1 0.05) was achieved. The designed thermo-responsive hydrogel (HG) was characterized by rheology, texture profile analysis, and ex vivo mucoadhesion, showing excellent mechanical and mucoadhesive properties. Ex vivo permeation studies of MSN-CCM and HG@MSN-CCM showed high permeation values (12.46 \u00b1 1.08 and 28.40 \u00b1 1.88 \u03bcg cm-2 of CCM, respectively) in porcine nasal mucosa. In vivo studies performed in a streptozotocin-induced AD model confirmed that HG@MSN-CCM reverted the cognitive deficit in mice, acting as a potential formulation in the treatment of AD.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Synthesis, Neuroprotective Effect and Physicochemical Studies of Novel Peptide and Nootropic Analogues of Alzheimer Disease Drug.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. Excessive glutamate transmission can lead to increased calcium ion expression, related to increased neurotoxicity. Memantine is used for treating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its protective action on the neurons against toxicity caused by over activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Nootropics, also called \"smart drugs\", are used for the treatment of cognitive deficits. In this work, we evaluate the neuroprotective action of four memantine analogues of glycine derivatives, including glycyl-glycine, glycyl-glycyl-glycine, sarcosine, dimethylglycine and three conjugates with nootropics, modafinil, piracetam and picamilon. The new structural memantine derivatives improved cell viability against copper-induced neurotoxicity in APPswe cells and glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Among these novel compounds, modafinil-memantine, piracetam-memantine, sarcosine-memantine, dimethylglycine-memantine, and glycyl-glycine-memantine were demonstrated with good EC50 values of the protective effects on APPswe cells, accompanied with moderate amelioration from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that novel structural derivatives of memantine might have the potential to develop promising lead compounds for the treatment of AD. The solubility of memantine analogues with nootropics and memantine analogues with glycine derivatives in buffer solutions at pH 2.0 and pH 7.4 simulating the biological media at 298.15 K was determined and the mutual influence of the structural fragments in the molecules on the solubility behavior was analyzed. The significative correlation equations relating the solubility and biological properties with the structural HYBOT (Hydrogen Bond Thermodynamics) descriptors were derived. These equations would greatly simplify the task of the directed design of the memantine analogues with improved solubility and enhanced bioavailability.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Pueraria lobata leaves contain a variety of phytoestrogens, including flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and coumestan derivatives. In this study, we aimed to identify the active ingredients of P. lobata leaves and to elucidate their function in monoamine oxidase (MAO) activation and A\u03b2 self-aggregation using in vitro and in silico approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate coumestrol as a selective and competitive MAO-A inhibitor. We identified that coumestrol, a coumestan-derivative, exhibited a selective inhibitory effect against MAO-A (IC50 = 1.99 \u00b1 0.68 \u00b5M), a key target protein for depression. In a kinetics analysis with 0.5 \u00b5g MAO-A, 40-160 \u00b5M substrate, and 25 \u00b0C reaction conditions, coumestrol acts as a competitive MAO-A inhibitor with an inhibition constant of 1.32 \u00b5M. During an in silico molecular docking analysis, coumestrol formed hydrogen bonds with FAD and pi-pi bonds with hydrophobic residues at the active site of the enzyme. Moreover, based on thioflavin-T-based fluorometric assays, we elucidated that coumestrol effectively prevented self-aggregation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2), which induces an inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS) and is a major cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, coumestrol could be used as a CNS drug to prevent diseases such as depression and AD by the inhibition of MAO-A and A\u03b2 self-aggregation.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter deficits, and neurodegeneration, which finally leads to neuronal death. Emerging evidence highlighted that hyperglycemia and brain insulin resistance represent risk factors for AD development, thus suggesting the existence of an additional AD form, associated with glucose metabolism impairment, named type 3 diabetes. Owing to the limited pharmacological options, novel strategies, especially dietary approaches based on the consumption of polyphenols, have been addressed to prevent or, at least, slow down AD progression. Among polyphenols, ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative, widely distributed in nature, especially in cereal bran and fruits, and known to be endowed with many bioactivities, especially antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic, thus suggesting it could be exploited as a possible novel neuroprotective strategy. Considering the importance of ferulic acid as a bioactive molecule and its widespread distribution in foods and medicinal plants, the aim of the present narrative review is to provide an overview on the existing preclinical and clinical evidence about the neuroprotective properties and mechanisms of action of ferulic acid, also focusing on its ability to modulate glucose homeostasis, in order to support a further therapeutic interest for AD and type 3 diabetes.",

All analogues were found to exhibit good inhibitory potential against cholinesterase enzymes, having IC50 values in the ranges of 0.10 \u00b1 0.05 to 11.10 \u00b1 0.30 \u00b5M (for AChE) and 0.20 \u00b1 0.050 \u00b5M to 14.20 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b5M (for BuChE) as compared to the standard drug Donepezil (IC50 = 2.16 \u00b1 0.12 and 4.5 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5M, respectively). Among the series, analogues 16 and 21 were found to be the most potent inhibitors of AChE and BuChE enzymes. The number (s), types, electron-donating or -withdrawing effects and position of the substituent(s) on the both phenyl rings B & C were the primary determinants of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). In order to understand how the most active derivatives interact with the amino acids in the active site of the enzyme, molecular docking studies were conducted. The results obtained supported the experimental data. Additionally, the structures of all newly synthesized compounds were elucidated by using several spectroscopic methods like 13C-NMR, 1H-NMR and HR EIMS.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Background and Objectives: This article presents data from the ongoing Aiginition Longitudinal Biomarker Investigation of Neurodegeneration study (ALBION) regarding baseline clinical characterizations and CSF biomarker profiles, as well as preliminary longitudinal data on clinical progression. Materials and Methods: As of March 2022, 138 participants who either were cognitively normal (CN, n = 99) or had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 39) had been recruited at the specialist cognitive disorders outpatient clinic at Aiginition Hospital. Clinical characteristics at baseline were provided. These patients were followed annually to determine progression from CN to MCI or even dementia. CSF biomarker data (amyloid \u03b21-42, phosphorylated tau at threonine 181, and total tau) collected using automated Elecsys\u00ae assays (Roche Diagnostics) were available for 74 patients. These patients were further sorted based on the AT(N) classification model, as determined by CSF A\u03b242 (A), CSF pTau (T), and CSF tTau (N). Results: Of the 49 CN patients with CSF biomarker data, 21 (43%) were classified as exhibiting \"Alzheimer's pathologic change\" (A+\u03a4- (\u039d)-) and 6 (12%) as having \"Alzheimer's disease\" (A+T-(N)+, A+T+(N)-, or A+T+(N)+). Of the 25 MCI patients, 8 (32%) displayed \"Alzheimer's pathologic change\", and 6 (24%) had \"Alzheimer's disease\". A total of 66 individuals had a mean follow-up of 2.1 years (SD = 0.9, min = 0.8, max = 3.9), and 15 of those individuals (22%) showed a clinical progression (defined as a worsening clinical classification, i.e., from CN to MCI or dementia or from MCI to dementia). Overall, participants with the \"AD continuum\" AT(N) biomarker profile (i.e., A+T-(N)-, A+T-(N)+, A+T+(N)-, and A+T+(N)+) were more likely to clinically progress (p = 0.04).&amp;nbsp;Conclusions: A CSF \"AD continuum\" AT(N) biomarker profile&amp;nbsp;is associated with an increased risk of future clinical decline in CN or MCI subjects.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) has been verified as an important causative factor for early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). PSEN1 is a part of \u03b3-secretase, and in addition to amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, it can also affect other processes, such as Notch signaling, \u03b2-cadherin processing, and calcium metabolism. Several motifs and residues have been identified in PSEN1, which may play a significant role in \u03b3-secretase mechanisms, such as the WNF, GxGD, and PALP motifs. More than 300 mutations have been described in PSEN1; however, the clinical phenotypes related to these mutations may be diverse. In addition to classical EOAD, patients with PSEN1 mutations regularly present with atypical phenotypic symptoms, such as spasticity, seizures, and visual impairment. In vivo and in vitro studies were performed to verify the effect of PSEN1 mutations on EOAD. The pathogenic nature of PSEN1 mutations can be categorized according to the ACMG-AMP guidelines; however, some mutations could not be categorized because they were detected only in a single case, and their presence could not be confirmed in family members. Genetic modifiers, therefore, may play a critical role in the age of disease onset and clinical phenotypes of PSEN1 mutations. This review introduces the role of PSEN1 in \u03b3-secretase, the clinical phenotypes related to its mutations, and possible significant residues of the protein.",

Despite extensive research efforts, only a few longevity genes have been validated across populations. Long-lived individuals (LLI) reach extreme ages with a relative low prevalence of chronic disability and major age-related diseases (ARDs). We tested whether the protection from ARDs in LLI can partly be attributed to genetic factors by calculating polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for seven common late-life diseases (Alzheimer's disease (AD), atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD), colorectal cancer (CRC), ischemic stroke (ISS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D)). The examined sample comprised 1351 German LLI (\u226594 years, including 643 centenarians) and 4680 German younger controls. For all ARD-PRSs tested, the LLI had significantly lower scores than the younger control individuals (areas under the curve (AUCs): ISS = 0.59, p = 2.84 \u00d7 10-35; AD = 0.59, p = 3.16 \u00d7 10-25; AF = 0.57, p = 1.07 \u00d7 10-16; CAD = 0.56, p = 1.88 \u00d7 10-12; CRC = 0.52, p = 5.85 \u00d7 10-3; PD = 0.52, p = 1.91 \u00d7 10-3; T2D = 0.51, p = 2.61 \u00d7 10-3). We combined the individual ARD-PRSs into a meta-PRS (AUC = 0.64, p = 6.45 \u00d7 10-15). We also generated two genome-wide polygenic scores for longevity, one with and one without the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 gene region (AUC (incl. TOMM40/APOE/APOC1) = 0.56, p = 1.45 \u00d7 10-5, seven variants; AUC (excl. TOMM40/APOE/APOC1) = 0.55, p = 9.85 \u00d7 10-3, 10,361 variants). Furthermore, the inclusion of nine markers from the excluded region (not in LD with each other) plus the APOE haplotype into the model raised the AUC from 0.55 to 0.61. Thus, our results highlight the importance of TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 as a longevity hub.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Amyloid aggregation is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current technologies using phototherapy for amyloid inhibition are usually photodynamic approaches based on evidence that reactive oxygen species can inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation. Herein, we report a novel combinational photothermally assisted photo-oxygenation treatment based on a nano-platform of the brain-targeting peptide RVG conjugated with the 2D porphyrinic PCN-222 metal-organic framework and indocyanine green (PCN-222@ICG@RVG) with enhanced photo-inhibition in Alzheimer's A\u03b2 aggregation. A photothermally assisted photo-oxygenation treatment based on PCN@ICG could largely enhance the photo-inhibition effect on A\u03b242 aggregation and lead to much lower neurotoxicity upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation at 808 nm compared with a single modality of photo-treatment in both cell-free and in vitro experiments. Generally, local photothermal heat increases the instability of A\u03b2 aggregates and keeps A\u03b2 in the status of monomers, which facilitates the photo-oxygenation process of generating oxidized A\u03b2 monomers with low aggregation capability. In addition, combined with the brain-targeting peptide RVG, the PCN-222@ICG@RVG nanoprobe shows high permeability of the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) on a human brain-on-a-chip platform. The ex vivo study also demonstrates that NIR-activated PCN-222@ICG@RVG could efficiently dissemble A\u03b2 plaques. Our work suggests that the combination of photothermal treatment with photo-oxygenation can synergistically enhance the inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation, which may boost NIR-based combinational phototherapy of AD in the future.",

This study aimed to assess the relationships between biological processes of the synaptic pathology underlying AD, molecular functions, and dynamics of the change concentrations of selected proteins reflecting synaptic and axonal pathology in dementia stages. Neurogranin (Ng), neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR), and Visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP1) concentrations were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MCI, AD, and non-demented controls (CTRL) using quantitative immunological methods. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was used for the functional analysis of tested proteins. The CSF A\u03b242/Ng ratio was significantly different between all the compared groups. The CSF NPTXR/Ng ratio was significantly different between MCI compared to CTRL and AD compared to CTRL. The GO enrichment analysis revealed that two terms (the Biological Process (BP) and Cellular Component (CC) levels) are significantly enriched for NPTXR and Ng but not for VILIP1. Both Ng and NPTXR concentrations in CSF are promising synaptic dysfunction biomarkers for the early diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, both proteins are biochemically associated with classical biomarkers and VILIP-1. Mapping shared molecular and biological functions for the tested proteins by GO enrichment analysis may be beneficial in screening and setting new research targets.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. Approximately 50% of AD patients show anxiety and depressive symptoms, which may contribute to cognitive decline. We aimed to investigate whether the triple-transgenic mouse (3xTg-AD) is a good preclinical model of this co-morbidity. The characteristic histological hallmarks are known to appear around 6-month; thus, 4- and 8-month-old male mice were compared with age-matched controls. A behavioral test battery was used to examine anxiety- (open field (OF), elevated plus maze, light-dark box, novelty suppressed feeding, and social interaction (SI) tests), and depression-like symptoms (forced swim test, tail suspension test, sucrose preference test, splash test, and learned helplessness) as well as the cognitive decline (Morris water maze (MWM) and social discrimination (SD) tests). Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry visualized cholinergic fibers in the cortex. Dexamethasone-test evaluated the glucocorticoid non-suppression. In the MWM, the 3xTg-AD mice found the platform later than controls in the 8-month-old cohort. The SD abilities of the 3xTg-AD mice were missing at both ages. In OF, both age groups of 3xTg-AD mice moved significantly less than the controls. During SI, 8-month-old 3xTg-AD animals spent less time with friendly social behavior than the controls. In the splash test, 3xTg-AD mice groomed themselves significantly less than controls of both ages. Cortical fiber density was lower in 8-month-old 3xTg-AD mice compared to the control. Dexamethasone non-suppression was detectable in the 4-month-old group. All in all, some anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms were present in 3xTg-AD mice. Although this strain was not generally more anxious or depressed, some aspects of comorbidity might be studied in selected tests, which may help to develop new possible treatments.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia, closely related to epigenetic factors. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification, affecting the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative diseases. This study was the first exploration of the combined role of 25 common m6A RNA methylation regulators in AD through the integrated bioinformatics approaches. The 14 m6A regulators related to AD were selected by analyzing differences between AD patients and normal controls. Based on the selected m6A regulators, AD patients could be well classified into two m6A models using consensus clustering. The two clusters of patients had different immune profiles, and m6A regulators were associated with the components of immune cells. Additionally, there were 19 key AD genes obtained by screening differential genes through weighted gene co-expression network and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis, which were highly associated with important m6A regulators during the occurrence of AD. More interestingly, NOTCH2 and NME1 could be potential targets for m6A regulation of AD. Taken together, these findings indicate that dysregulation of m6A methylation affects the occurrence of AD and is vital for the subtype classification and immune infiltration of AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The extracellular accumulation of aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in the brain leads to the early pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The administration of exogenous plant-type ceramides into AD model mice can promote the release of neuronal exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicles, that can mediate A\u03b2 clearance. In vitro studies showed that the length of fatty acids in mammalian-type ceramides is crucial for promoting neuronal exosome release. Therefore, investigating the structures of plant ceramides is important for evaluating the potential in releasing exosomes to remove A\u03b2. In this study, we assessed plant ceramide species with D-erythro-(4E,8Z)-sphingadienine and D-erythro-(8Z)-phytosphingenine as sphingoid bases that differ from mammalian-type species. Some plant ceramides were more effective than mammalian ceramides at stimulating exosome release. In addition, using deuterium chemistry-based lipidomics, most exogenous plant ceramides were confirmed to be derived from exosomes. These results suggest that the ceramide-dependent upregulation of exosome release may promote the release of exogenous ceramides from cells, and plant ceramides with long-chain fatty acids can effectively release neuronal exosomes and prevent AD pathology.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "In comparing two human lung cancer cells, we previously found lower levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and intact amyloid-\u03b240/42 (A\u03b2), and higher levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) in the media of H1299 cells as compared to A549 cell media. In this study, we hypothesized that the levels of soluble amyloid precursor protein \u03b1 (sAPP\u03b1) are regulated by AChE and mBDNF in A549 and H1299 cell media. The levels of sAPP\u03b1 were higher in the media of H1299 cells. Knockdown of AChE led to increased sAPP\u03b1 and mBDNF levels and correlated with decreased levels of intact A\u03b240/42 in A549 cell media. AChE and mBDNF had opposite effects on the levels of A\u03b2 and sAPP\u03b1 and were found to operate through a mechanism involving \u03b1-secretase activity. Treatment with AChE decreased sAPP\u03b1 levels and simultaneously increased the levels of intact A\u03b240/42 suggesting a role of the protein in shifting APP processing away from the non-amyloidogenic pathway and toward the amyloidogenic pathway, whereas treatment with mBDNF led to opposite effects on those levels. We also show that the levels of sAPP\u03b1 are regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, phosphoinositide 3 Kinase (PI3K), but not by protein kinase A (PKA).",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Tau is a widespread neuroprotein that regulates the cytoskeleton assembly. In some neurological disorders, known as tauopathies, tau is dissociated from the microtubule and forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles. Tau comprises four pseudorepeats (R1-R4), containing one (R1, R2, R4) or two (R3) histidines, that potentially act as metal binding sites. Moreover, Cys291 and Cys322 in R2 and R3, respectively, might have an important role in protein aggregation, through possible disulfide bond formation, and/or affecting the binding and reactivity of redox-active metal ions, as copper. We, therefore, compare the interaction of copper with octadeca-R3-peptide (R3C) and with the mutant containing an alanine residue (R3A) to assess the role of thiol group. Spectrophotometric titrations allow to calculate the formation constant of the copper(I) complexes, showing a remarkable stronger interaction in the case of R3C (log Kf = 13.4 and 10.5 for copper(I)-R3C and copper(I)-R3A, respectively). We also evaluate the oxidative reactivity associated to these copper complexes in the presence of dopamine and ascorbate. Both R3A and R3C peptides increase the capability of copper to oxidize catechols, but copper-R3C displays a peculiar mechanism due to the presence of cysteine. HPLC-MS analysis shows that cysteine can form disulfide bonds and dopamine-Cys covalent adducts, with potential implication in tau aggregation process.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neuroinflammation has a major role in several brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet at present there are no effective anti-neuroinflammatory therapeutics available. Copper(II) complexes of bis(thiosemicarbazones) (CuII(gtsm) and CuII(atsm)) have broad therapeutic actions in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, with CuII(atsm) demonstrating beneficial outcomes on neuroinflammatory markers in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that copper(II) complexes could be harnessed as a new approach to modulate immune function in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined the anti-neuroinflammatory action of several low-molecular-weight, charge-neutral and lipophilic copper(II) complexes. Our analysis revealed that one compound, a thiosemicarbazone-pyridylhydrazone copper(II) complex (CuL5), delivered copper into cells in vitro and increased the concentration of copper in the brain in vivo. In a primary murine microglia culture, CuL5 was shown to decrease secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf), increase expression of metallothionein (Mt1), and modulate expression of Alzheimer's disease-associated risk genes, Trem2 and Cd33. CuL5 also improved the phagocytic function of microglia in vitro. In 5xFAD model AD mice, treatment with CuL5 led to an improved performance in a spatial working memory test, while, interestingly, increased accumulation of amyloid plaques in treated mice. These findings demonstrate that CuL5 can induce anti-neuroinflammatory effects in vitro and provide selective benefit in vivo. The outcomes provide further support for the development of copper-based compounds to modulate neuroinflammation in brain diseases.",

In a previous study, we confirmed that carboxy-dehydroevodiamine\u2219HCl (cx-DHED), a derivative of DHED, was effective at improving cognitive impairment and reducing phosphorylated tau levels and synaptic loss in an AD mouse model. However, the specific mechanism of action of cx-DHED is unclear. In this study, we investigated how the cx-DHED attenuates AD pathologies in the 5xFAD mouse model, focusing particularly on abnormal glucose metabolism. We analyzed behavioral changes and AD pathologies in mice after intraperitoneal injection of cx-DHED for 2 months. As expected, cx-DHED reversed memory impairment and reduced A\u03b2 plaques and astrocyte overexpression in the brains of 5xFAD mice. Interestingly, cx-DHED reversed the abnormal expression of glucose transporters in the brains of 5xFAD mice. In addition, otherwise low O-GlcNac levels increased, and the overactivity of phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 decreased in the brains of cx-DHED-treated 5xFAD mice. Finally, the reduction in synaptic proteins was found to also improve by treatment with cx-DHED. Therefore, we specifically demonstrated the protective effects of cx-DHED against AD pathologies and suggest that cx-DHED may be a potential therapeutic drug for AD.",

Functional investigation of the ABCB1 expression is also essential in many diseases, including drug-resistant cancer, inflammatory conditions, or Alzheimer disease. In this study, we examined the potential interaction of the ABCB1 multidrug transporter with a group of commercially available viability dyes that are generally considered not to penetrate into intact cells. Here, we demonstrate that the slow cellular accumulation of TO-PRO\u2122-1 (TP1) or TO-PRO\u2122-3 (TP3) was strongly inhibited by ABCB1-dependent dye extrusion. TP1/3 dye accumulation was not affected by the presence of ABCC1 or ABCG2, while this uptake was increased to the level in the ABCB1-negative cells by a specific P-glycoprotein inhibitor, Tariquidar. We suggest that TP compounds can be used as highly sensitive, selective, non-toxic, and stable dyes to examine the functional expression and properties of the ABCB1 multidrug transporter, especially in microplate-based high-throughput flow cytometry assays. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of the TP dyes to efficiently select and separate even a very low number of Pgp-expressing intact cells.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of dementia, is caused in part by the aggregation and accumulation in the brain of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2), a product of the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in endosomes. Trafficking of APP, such as surface-intracellular recycling, is an early critical step required for A\u03b2 generation. Less is known, however, about the molecular mechanism regulating APP trafficking. This study investigated the mechanism by which SPIN90, along with Rab11, modulates APP trafficking, A\u03b2 motility and accumulation, and synaptic functionality. Brain A\u03b2 deposition was lower in the progeny of 5xFAD-SPIN90KO mice than in 5xFAD-SPIN90WT mice. Analysis of APP distribution and trafficking showed that the surface fraction of APP was locally distinct in axons and dendrites, with these distributions differing significantly in 5xFAD-SPIN90WT and 5xFAD-SPIN90KO mice, and that neural activity-driven APP trafficking to the surface and intracellular recycling were more actively mobilized in 5xFAD-SPIN90KO neurons. In addition, SPIN90 was found to be cotrafficked with APP via axons, with ablation of SPIN90 reducing the intracellular accumulation of APP in axons. Finally, synaptic transmission was restored over time in 5xFAD-SPIN90KO but not in 5xFAD-SPIN90WT neurons, suggesting SPIN90 is implicated in A\u03b2 production through the regulation of APP trafficking.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) is a crucial subunit within the \u03b3-secretase complex and regulates \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) production. Accumulated evidence indicates that n-butylidenephthalide (BP) acts effectively to reduce A\u03b2 levels in neuronal cells that are derived from trisomy 21 (Ts21) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. This article aims to investigate the possible mechanisms through which BP ameliorates the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and verify the effectiveness of BP through animal experiments. Results from RNA microarray analysis showed that BP treatment in Ts21 iPSC-derived neuronal cells reduced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) CYP3A43-2 levels and increased microRNA (miR)-29b-2-5p levels. Bioinformatics tool prediction analysis, biotin-labeled miR-29b-2-5p pull-down assay, and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed a direct negative regulatory effect for miRNA29b-2-5p on lnc-RNA-CYP3A43-2 and PSEN1. Moreover, BP administration improved short-term memory and significantly reduced A\u03b2 accumulation in the hippocampus and cortex of 3xTg-AD mice but failed in miR-29b-2-5p mutant mice generated by CRISP/Cas9 technology. In addition, analysis of brain samples from patients with AD showed a decrease in microRNA-29b-2-5p expression in the frontal cortex region. Our results provide evidence that the LncCYP3A43-2/miR29-2-5p/PSEN1 network might be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying BP-induced A\u03b2 reduction.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurogenesis plays a crucial role in cognitive processes. During aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), altered neurogenesis and neuroinflammation are evident both in C57BL/6J, APPSwe/PS1dE9 (Tg) mice and humans. AD pathology may slow down upon drug treatment, for example, in a previous study of our group P33, a putative neuroprotective agent was found to exert advantageous effects on the elevated levels of APP, A\u03b2, and neuroinflammation. In the present study, we aimed to examine longitudinal alterations in neurogenesis, neuroinflammation and AD pathology in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model, and assessed the putative beneficial effects of long-term P33 treatment on AD-specific neurological alterations. Hippocampal cell proliferation and differentiation were significantly reduced between 8 and 12 months of age. Regarding neuroinflammation, significantly elevated astrogliosis and microglial activation were observed in 6- to 7-month-old Tg animals. The amounts of the molecules involved in the amyloidogenic pathway were altered from 4 months of age in Tg animals. P33-treatment led to significantly increased neurogenesis in 9-month-old animals. Our data support the hypothesis that altered neurogenesis may be a consequence of AD pathology. Based on our findings in the transgenic animal model, early pharmacological treatment before the manifestation of AD symptoms might ameliorate neurological decline.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a selective barrier and a functional gatekeeper for the central nervous system (CNS), essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. The BBB is composed of specialized brain endothelial cells (BECs) lining the brain capillaries. The tight junctions formed by BECs regulate paracellular transport, whereas transcellular transport is regulated by specialized transporters, pumps and receptors. Cytokine-induced neuroinflammation, such as the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), appear to play a role in BBB dysfunction and contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by contributing to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide accumulation. Here, we investigated whether TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 modulate the permeability of the BBB and alter A\u03b2 peptide transport across BECs. We used a human BBB in vitro model based on the use of brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs) obtained from endothelial cells derived from CD34+ stem cells cocultivated with brain pericytes. We demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 differentially induced changes in BLECs' permeability by inducing alterations in the organization of junctional complexes as well as in transcelluar trafficking. Further, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 act directly on BLECs by decreasing LRP1 and BCRP protein expression as well as the specific efflux of A\u03b2 peptide. These results provide mechanisms by which CNS inflammation might modulate BBB permeability and promote A\u03b2 peptide accumulation. A future therapeutic intervention targeting vascular inflammation at the BBB may have the therapeutic potential to slow down the progression of AD.",

Two polymorphisms have implicated ABI3 as a modulator of AD risk. Here, we sought to identify ABI3 isoforms expressed in human AD and non-AD brain, quantify the more abundant isoforms as a function of AD genetics and neuropathology, and provide an initial in vitro characterization of the proteins produced by these novel isoforms. We report that ABI3 expression is increased with AD neuropathology but not associated with AD genetics. Single-cell RNAseq of APP/PS1 mice showed that Abi3 is primarily expressed by microglia, including disease-associated microglia. In human brain, several novel ABI3 isoforms were identified, including isoforms with partial or complete loss of exon 6. Expression of these isoforms correlated tightly with total ABI3 expression but were not influenced by AD genetics. Lastly, we performed an initial characterization of these isoforms in transfected cells and found that, while full-length ABI3 was expressed in a dispersed punctate fashion within the cytosol, isoforms lacking most or all of exon six tended to form extensive protein aggregates. In summary, ABI3 expression is restricted to microglia, is increased with Alzheimer's neuropathology, and includes several isoforms that display a variable tendency to aggregate when expressed in vitro.",

Indeed, gut microbial dysbiosis has been identified in an increasing number of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, microbial alterations have been reported also in Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting possible pathogenetic mechanisms contributing to the development of specific AD hallmarks and exacerbating metabolic alterations and neuroinflammation. The identification of these mechanisms is crucial to develop novel, targeted therapies and identify potential biomarkers for diagnostic purposes. Thus, the possibility to have AD in vivo models to study this microbial ecosystem represents a great opportunity for translational applications. Here, we characterized both gut microbiome and mycobiome of 3xTg-AD mice, one of the most widely used AD models, to identify specific microbial alterations with respect to the wild-type counterpart. Interestingly, we found a significant reduction of the Coprococcus and an increased abundance of Escherichia_Shigella and Barnesiella genera in the AD mice compatible with a pro-inflammatory status and the development of AD-related pathogenetic features. Moreover, the fungal Dipodascaceae family was significantly increased, thus suggesting a possible contribution to the metabolic alterations found in AD. Our data point out the strict connection between bacterial dysbiosis and AD and, even if further studies are required to clarify the underlining mechanisms, it clearly indicates the need for extensive metagenomic studies over the bacterial counterpart.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Brain imaging genetics examines associations between imaging quantitative traits (QTs) and genetic factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to provide important insights into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The individual level SNP-QT signals are high dimensional and typically have small effect sizes, making them hard to be detected and replicated. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a new approach that identifies high-level imaging genetic associations through applying multigraph clustering to the SNP-QT association maps. Given an SNP set and a brain QT set, the association between each SNP and each QT is evaluated using a linear regression model. Based on the resulting SNP-QT association map, five SNP-SNP similarity networks (or graphs) are created using five different scoring functions, respectively. Multigraph clustering is applied to these networks to identify SNP clusters with similar association patterns with all the brain QTs. After that, functional annotation is performed for each identified SNP cluster and its corresponding brain association pattern. We applied this pipeline to an AD imaging genetic study, which yielded promising results. For example, in an association study between 54 AD SNPs and 116 amyloid QTs, we identified two SNP clusters with one responsible for amyloid beta clearances and the other regulating amyloid beta formation. These high-level findings have the potential to provide valuable insights into relevant genetic pathways and brain circuits, which can help form new hypotheses for more detailed imaging and genetics studies in independent cohorts.",

However, currently, techniques with the required high sensitivity and specificity are lacking. Recently, with the advances and increased accessibility of data analysis tools, such as machine learning, research efforts have increasingly focused on using these computational methods to solve this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD diagnosis approach using the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) fingerprints of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). SERS and CNN were combined for biomarker detection to analyze disease-associated biochemical changes in the CSF. We achieved very high reproducibility in double-blind experiments for testing the feasibility of our system on human samples. We achieved an overall accuracy of 92% (100% for normal individuals and 88.9% for AD individuals) based on the clinical diagnosis. Further, we observed an excellent correlation coefficient between our test score and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score. Our findings offer a substantial indication of the feasibility of detecting AD biomarkers using the innovative combination of SERS and machine learning.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the proper control of mitochondrial dynamics provides a window for therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1a) has been shown to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons. Thus far, the roles of PGC-1a in Alzheimer's disease and its potential value for restoring mitochondrial dysfunction remain largely unknown. In the present study, we explored the impacts of PGC-1a on AD pathology and neurobehavioral dysfunction and its potential mechanisms with a particular focus on mitochondrial dynamics. Paralleling AD-related pathological deposits, neuronal apoptosis, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and lowered membrane potential, a remarkable reduction in the expression of PGC-1a was shown in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice at 6 months of age. By infusing AAV-Ppargc1\u03b1 into the lateral parietal association (LPtA) cortex of the APP/PS1 brain, we found that PGC-1a ameliorated AD-like behavioral abnormalities, such as deficits in spatial reference memory, working memory and sensorimotor gating. Notably, overexpressed PGC-1a in LPtA rescued mitochondrial swelling and damage in neurons, likely through correcting the altered balance in mitochondrial fission-fusion and its abnormal distribution. Our findings support the notion that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics is likely an important mechanism that leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and AD-related pathological and cognitive impairments, and they indicate the potential value of PGC-1a for restoring mitochondrial dynamics as an innovative therapeutic target for AD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. Cortical and hippocampal hyperexcitability intervenes in the pathological derangement of brain activity leading to cognitive decline. As key regulators of neuronal excitability, the voltage-gated K+ channels (KV) might play a crucial role in the AD pathophysiology. Among them, the KV2.1 channel, the main \u03b1 subunit mediating the delayed rectifier K+ currents (IDR) and controlling the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, has been poorly examined in AD. In the present study, we investigated the KV2.1 protein expression and activity in hippocampal neurons from the Tg2576 mouse, a widely used transgenic model of AD. To this aim we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. Our Western blotting results reveal that KV2.1 was overexpressed in the hippocampus of 3-month-old Tg2576 mice and in primary hippocampal neurons from Tg2576 mouse embryos compared with the WT counterparts. Electrophysiological experiments unveiled that the whole IDR were reduced in the Tg2576 primary neurons compared with the WT neurons, and that this reduction was due to the loss of the KV2.1 current component. Moreover, we found that the reduction of the KV2.1-mediated currents was due to increased channel clustering, and that glutamate, a stimulus inducing KV2.1 declustering, was able to restore the IDR to levels comparable to those of the WT neurons. These findings add new information about the dysregulation of ionic homeostasis in the Tg2576 AD mouse model and identify KV2.1 as a possible player in the AD-related alterations of neuronal excitability.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The societal burden of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other major forms of dementia continues to grow, and multiple pharmacological agents directed towards modifying the pathological \"hallmarks\" of AD have yielded disappointing results. Though efforts continue towards broadening and deepening our knowledge and understanding of the mechanistic and neuropathological underpinnings of AD, our previous failures motivate a re-examination of how we conceptualize AD pathology and progression. In addition to not yielding effective treatments, the phenotypically heterogeneous biological processes that have been the primary area of focus to date have not been adequately shown to be necessary or sufficient to explain the risk and progression of AD. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence indicates that lifestyle and environment represent the ultimate level of causation for AD and age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, the decline in cognitive demands over the lifespan plays a central role in driving the structural and functional deteriorations of the brain. In the absence of adequate cognitive stimulus, physiological demand-function coupling leads to downregulation of growth, repair, and homeostatic processes, resulting in deteriorating brain tissue health, function, and capacity. In this setting, the heterogeneity of associated neuropathological tissue hallmarks then occurs as a consequence of an individual's genetic and environmental background and are best considered downstream markers of the disease process rather than specific targets for direct intervention. In this manuscript we outline the evidence for a demand-driven model of age-related cognitive decline and dementia and why it mandates a holistic approach to dementia treatment and prevention that incorporates the primary upstream role of cognitive demand.",

Even though a bulk of evidence has uncovered the role of metals in the generation of the toxic pathways at the base of Alzheimer's disease (AD), this matter has been sidelined by the advent of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis. However, the link between metals and AD has been investigated in the last two decades, focusing on their local accumulation in brain areas known to be critical for AD. Recent evidence revealed a relation between iron and AD, particularly in relation to its capacity to increase the risk of the disease through ferroptosis.

However, the details of the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. The present study aims to examine the spreading of P301S aggregated tau, a mutation that is implicated in tauopathies, using organotypic slice cultures. Coronal hippocampal organotypic brain slices (170 \u00b5m) were prepared from postnatal (day 8-10) C57BL6 wild-type mice. Collagen hydrogels loaded with P301S aggregated tau were applied to slices and the spread of tau was assessed by immunohistochemistry after 8 weeks in culture. Collagen hydrogels prove to be an effective protein delivery system subject to natural degradation in 14 days and they release tau proteins up to 8 weeks. Slices with un- and hyperphosphorylated P301S aggregated tau demonstrate significant spreading to the ventral parts of the hippocampal slices compared to empty collagen hydrogels after 8 weeks. Moreover, the spread of P301S aggregated tau occurs in a time-dependent manner, which was interrupted when the neuroanatomical pathways are lesioned. We illustrate that the spreading of tau can be investigated in organotypic slice cultures using collagen hydrogels to achieve a localized application and slow release of tau proteins.

        "ArticleAbstract": "The heterogeneous and multi-factorial nature of dementia requires the consideration of all health aspects when predicting the risk of its development and planning strategies for its prevention. This systematic review of reviews provides a comprehensive synthesis of those factors associated with cognition in the context of dementia, identifying the role of social aspects and evidencing knowledge gaps in this area of research. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses from 2009-2021 were searched for within Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos. Reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and assessed the records, following the PRISMA-2020 guidelines. From 314 included studies, 624 cognitive-related factors were identified, most of them risk factors (61.2%), mainly belonging to the group of 'somatic comorbidities' (cardiovascular disease and diabetes) and 'genetic predispositions'. The protective factors (20%) were mainly related to lifestyle, pointing to the Mediterranean diet, regular physical activity, and cognitively stimulating activities. Social factors constituted 9.6% of all identified factors. Research on biological and medical factors dominates the reviewed literature. Greater social support and frequent contact may confer some protection against cognitive decline and dementia by delaying its onset or reducing the overall risk; however, overall, our findings are inconsistent. Further research is needed in the fields of lifestyle, psychology, social health, and the protective factors against cognitive decline and dementia.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "This study aimed to identify cases of potential prodromal DLB in very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP), using indicative biomarkers of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and to evaluate the characteristics of psychosis as prodromal DLB.Data of patients with VLOSLP without dementia and Parkinsonism, who underwent testing for at least one indicative biomarker of DLB, were retrospectively collected from the database of the psychiatry clinic at the Osaka University Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups based on the positive (VLOSLP+LB) and negative (VLOSLP-LB) results of the indicative biomarkers of DLB. Age, gender, cognitive battery scores, prevalence of each type of delusions and hallucinations, cerebral volume, and cerebral perfusion were compared between the two groups.Eleven VLOSLP+LB and 23 VLOSLP-LB participants were enrolled. There were no significant differences in age, proportion of females, and MMSE scores between the two groups. The standardized score of the digit symbol substitution test was significantly lower in the VLOSLP+LB than in VLOSLP-LB group (6.9 [3.1] vs. 10.0 [2.7], p = 0.005). The prevalence of visual hallucinations was significantly higher in the VLOSLP+LB group than in the VLOSLP-LB group (81.8% vs. 26.1%, p = 0.003). Auditory hallucinations were prevalent in both groups (43.5% in VLOSLP-LB, and 45.5% in VLOSLP+LB). Among patients with auditory hallucinations, auditory hallucinations without coexistent visual hallucinations tended to be more prevalent in VLOSLP-LB (7 out of 10) than in VLOSLP+LB patients (1 out of 5). Although cerebral volume was not different in any region, cerebral perfusion in the posterior region, including the occipital lobe, was significantly lower in the VLOSLP+LB group.Psychomotor slowing, visual hallucinations, and reduced perfusion in the occipital lobe may be suggestive of prodromal DLB in VLOSLP patients, even though the clinical manifestations were similar in many respects between VLOSLP+LB and VLOSLP-LB. Although auditory hallucinations were prevalent in both groups, most patients in VLOSLP+LB complained of auditory hallucinations along with visual hallucinations. Future studies with a larger number of patients without selection bias are desirable.",

We developed multimodal models for f-FTD disease progression and estimated clinical trial sample sizes in C9orf72, GRN and MAPT mutation carriers. Models included longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological scores, regional brain volumes and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) in 796 carriers and 412 noncarrier controls. We found that the temporal ordering of clinical and biomarker progression differed by genotype. In prevention-trial simulations using model-based patient selection, atrophy and NfL were the best endpoints, whereas clinical measures were potential endpoints in early symptomatic trials. f-FTD prevention trials are feasible but will likely require global recruitment efforts. These disease progression models will facilitate the planning of f-FTD clinical trials, including the selection of optimal endpoints and enrollment criteria to maximize power to detect treatment effects.",

These techniques comprise spontaneous and resonant Raman spectroscopies, exploit plasmon- or fiber- enhanced effects, such as surface-, tip- or fiber- enhanced Raman spectroscopies, or involve non-linear techniques like coherent Raman scattering. The scientific efforts employed up to now as well as the rapid technological advancements in optical detection instruments (spectrometers, lasers, substrates for analysis, etc.) and the diffusion of advanced data processing methods suggest a leading role of Raman techniques in the perspective of a preclinical or clinical detection of AD.",

Cognitive function and activity of daily living were evaluated. Neuropsychological tests and blood samples were gathered at baseline and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks after rTMS therapy.There were no evident differences between rTMS group and sham group in serum A\u03b240, A\u03b242, total A\u03b2, ApoE, and p75ECD standards at baseline (p > 0.05). Serum levels of A\u03b240, A\u03b242, as well as total A\u03b2, were significantly lower in the rTMS group at 3, 4 and 6 weeks relative to the sham group (p < 0.05).

Uncovering disease heterogeneity by using functional networks could provide insights into precise diagnoses.We investigated the subtypes of AD using nonnegative matrix factorization clustering on the previously identified 216 resting-state functional connectivities that differed between AD and normal control subjects. We conducted the analysis using a discovery dataset (n\u00a0= 809) and a validated dataset (n\u00a0= 291). Next, we grouped individuals with mild cognitive impairment according to the model obtained in the AD groups. Finally, the clinical measures and brain structural characteristics were compared among the subtypes to assess their relationship with differences in the functional network.Individuals with AD were clustered into 4 subtypes reproducibly, which included those with 1) diffuse and mild functional connectivity disruption (subtype 1), 2) predominantly decreased connectivity in the default mode network accompanied by an increase in the prefrontal circuit (subtype 2), 3) predominantly decreased connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex accompanied by an increase in prefrontal cortex connectivity (subtype 3), and 4) predominantly decreased connectivity in the basal ganglia accompanied by an increase in prefrontal cortex connectivity (subtype 4). In addition to these differences in functional connectivity, differences between the AD subtypes were found in cognition, structural measures, and cognitive decline patterns.These comprehensive results offer new insights that may advance precision medicine for AD and facilitate strategies for future clinical trials.",

High N\u03b4H (tautomer of natural histidine) content would increase Alzheimer's disease risk. To inhibit this and improve the activation of N-H and C-H bonds, the isomerization mechanism from N\u03b4H to N\u03b5H of histidine-containing dipeptide catalyzed by water cluster was explored. The results discovered that water cluster assists this reaction by reducing the activation energies from 68.20 to 9.60\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol-1, and its size not only affects the reaction rate but also determines the reaction pathway in a degree. Moreover, water cluster, taken as a potential green catalyst, is more effective on the reactions involving N-H and C-H bond cleavages than reported common toxic organometallic compounds and has different catalytic mechanisms. This work also provides some theoretical guidance for the modulation of Alzheimer's disease induced by histidine isomerization.",

N-Deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 3 (NDST3) is known to catalyze deacetylation and N-sulfation on disaccharide substrates. Recently, NDST3 is identified as a novel deacetylase for tubulin, and its newly recognized role in modulating microtubule acetylation and lysosomal acidification provides fresh insights into ND therapeutic approaches using NDST3 as a target. Microtubule acetylation and lysosomal acidification have been reported to be critical for activities in neurons, implying that the regulators of these two biological processes, such as the previously known microtubule deacetylases, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), could play important roles in various NDs. Aberrant NDST3 expression or tubulin acetylation has been observed in an increasing number of NDs, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that NDST3 is a key player in the pathogenesis of NDs and may serve as a target for development of new treatment of NDs.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "A key aim of Alzheimer disease research is to develop efficient therapies to prevent and/or delay the irreversible progression of cognitive impairments. Early deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) are associated with the accumulation of amyloid beta in rodent models of the disease; however, less is known about how mGluR-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is affected. In this study, we have found that mGluR-LTD is enhanced in the APPswe /PS1dE9 mouse at 7 but returns to wild-type levels at 13\u2009months of age. This transient over-activation of mGluR signalling is coupled with impaired LTP and shifts the dynamic range of synapses towards depression. These alterations in synaptic plasticity are associated with an inability to utilize cues in a spatial learning task. The transient dysregulation of plasticity can be prevented by genetic deletion of the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a substrate of p38 MAPK, demonstrating that manipulating the mGluR-p38 MAPK-MK2 cascade at 7\u00a0months can prevent the shift in synapse dynamic range.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between blood CD4/CD8 ratio and central nervous system endpoints in primary HIV infection (PHI) before and after antiretroviral treatment (ART).This was a retrospective analysis of the Primary Infection Stage CNS Events Study (PISCES) cohort. We longitudinally assessed blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of inflammation, immune activation and neuronal injury, and neuropsychological testing performance (NPZ4, an average of three motor and one processing speed tests, and a summarized total score, NPZ11, including also executive function, learning and memory) in ART-na\u00efve participants enrolled during PHI. Spearman correlation and linear mixed models assessed the relationships between the trajectory of CD4/CD8 ratio over time and neurocognitive performance, blood and CSF markers of immune activation and neuronal injury.In all, 109 PHI participants were enrolled. The mean CD4/CD8 ratio decreased with longer time from infection to starting treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Every unit increase in NPZ4 score was independently associated with a 0.15 increase in CD4/CD8 ratio (95% CI: 0.002-0.29; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047), whereas no correlation was found between CD4/CD8 ratio and NPZ11. Among the cognitive domains, only a change in processing speed was correlated with CD4/CD8 ratio over time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The trajectory of the CD4/CD8 ratio was negatively correlated with change in CSF neurofilament light chain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).The trajectory of CD4/CD8 ratio was independently associated with motor/psychomotor speed performance, suggesting that immune activation is involved in brain injury during the early stages of the infection.",

Notably, cortical excitability assessed over the l-PPC was comparable between the 2 groups. Furthermore, we found that the individual level of PC excitability was associated with the level of cognitive impairment, as measured with Mini-Mental State Examination, and with corticospinal fluid levels of A\u03b242 .Our data provide novel evidence that precuneus cortical hyperexcitability is a key feature of synaptic dysfunction in patients with AD.

To study them further, we investigated a panel of candidate genes in 102 Italian EOAD patients, 45.10% of whom had a positive family history and 21.74% with a strong family history of dementia. We found that 10.78% of patients carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, including a novel variant, in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP, and 7.84% showed homozygosity for the \u03b54 APOE allele. Additionally, 7.84% of patients had a moderate risk allele in PSEN1, PSEN2, or TREM2 genes. Besides, we observed that 12.75% of our patients carried only a variant in genes associated with other neurodegenerative diseases. The combination of these variants contributes to explain 46% of cases with a definite familiarity and 32% of sporadic forms. Our results confirm the importance of extensive genetic screening in EOAD for clinical purposes, to select patients for future treatments and to contribute to the definition of overlapping pathogenic mechanisms between AD and other forms of dementia.",

Extensive studies have shown that astrocytes and microglia play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, as well as glioma, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and infections. Positron emission tomography is a functional imaging technique providing molecular-level information before anatomic changes are visible and has been widely used in many above-mentioned diseases. In this review, we focus on the positron emission tomography tracers used in pathologies related to glial cells, such as glioma, Alzheimer's disease, and neuroinflammation.",

Propargyltacrine 23 (IC50 = 21\u2009nM) was the most potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, compound 20 (IC50 = 78\u2009nM) showed the best inhibitory human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) profile, and ligand 21 afforded equipotent and significant values on both ChEs (human AChE [hAChE]: IC50 = 0.095\u2009\u00b1\u20090.001\u00a0\u00b5M; hBChE: IC50 = 0.093\u2009\u00b1\u20090.003\u00a0\u00b5M).

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a reorganization of brain activity determining network hyperexcitability and loss of synaptic plasticity. Precisely, a dysfunction in metabotropic GABAB receptor signalling through G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK or Kir3) channels on the hippocampus has been postulated. Thus, we determined the impact of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathology in GIRK channel density, subcellular distribution, and its association with GABAB receptors in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons from the APP/PS1 mouse model using quantitative SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labelling (SDS-FRL) and proximity ligation in situ assay (P-LISA). In wild type mice, single SDS-FRL detection revealed a similar dendritic gradient for GIRK1 and GIRK2 in CA1 pyramidal cells, with higher densities in spines, and GIRK3 showed a lower and uniform distribution. Double SDS-FRL showed a co-clustering of GIRK2 and GIRK1 in post- and presynaptic compartments, but not for GIRK2 and GIRK3. Likewise, double GABAB1 and GIRK2 SDS-FRL detection displayed a high degree of co-clustering in nanodomains (40-50 nm) mostly in spines and axon terminals. In APP/PS1 mice, the density of GIRK2 and GIRK1, but not for GIRK3, was significantly reduced along the neuronal surface of CA1 pyramidal cells and in axon terminals contacting them. Importantly, GABAB1 and GIRK2 co-clustering was not present in APP/PS1 mice. Similarly, P-LISA experiments revealed a significant reduction in GABAB1 and GIRK2 interaction on the hippocampus of this animal model. Overall, our results provide compelling evidence showing a significant reduction on the cell surface density of pre- and postsynaptic GIRK1 and GIRK2, but not GIRK3, and a decline in GABAB receptors and GIRK2 channels co-clustering in hippocampal pyramidal neurons from APP/PS1 mice, thus suggesting that a disruption in the GABAB receptor-GIRK channel membrane assembly causes dysregulation in the GABAB signalling via GIRK channels in this AD animal model.",

New experimental systems that monitor neuronal functions in conditions approximating the AD brain may be beneficial for identifying new therapeutic strategies.We expose cultured neurons to aqueous-soluble human brain extract from 43 individuals across a spectrum of AD pathology. Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and live-cell imaging were used to assess neuronal firing and neurite integrity (NI), respectively, following treatments of rat cortical neurons (MEA) and human iPSC-derived neurons (iN) with human brain extracts.We observe associations between spontaneous activity and A\u03b242:40 levels, between neurite integrity and oligomeric A\u03b2, and between neurite integrity and tau levels present in the brain extracts. However, these associations with A\u03b2 and tau do not fully account for the effects observed. Proteomic profiling of the brain extracts revealed additional candidates correlated with neuronal structure and activity. Neurotoxicity in MEA and NI assays was associated with proteins implicated in lysosomal storage disorders, while neuroprotection was associated with proteins of the WAVE regulatory complex controlling actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Elevated ganglioside GM2 activator (GM2A) associates with reductions in both NI and MEA activity, and cell-derived GM2A alone is sufficient to induce a loss of neurite integrity and a reduction in neuronal firing.The techniques and data herein introduce a system for modeling neuronal vulnerability in response to factors in the human brain and provide insights into proteins potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The endosome-associated GTPase Rab5 is a central player in the molecular mechanisms leading to degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN), a long-standing target for drug development. As p38\u03b1 is a Rab5 activator, we hypothesized that inhibition of this kinase holds potential as an approach to treat diseases associated with BFCN loss. Herein, we report that neflamapimod (oral small molecule p38\u03b1 inhibitor) reduces Rab5 activity, reverses endosomal pathology, and restores the numbers and morphology of BFCNs in a mouse model that develops BFCN degeneration. We also report on the results of an exploratory (hypothesis-generating) phase 2a randomized double-blind 16-week placebo-controlled clinical trial (Clinical trial registration: NCT04001517/EudraCT #2019-001566-15) of neflamapimod in mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a disease in which BFCN degeneration is an important driver of disease expression. A total of 91 participants, all receiving background cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, were randomized 1:1 between neflamapimod 40\u2009mg or matching placebo capsules (taken orally twice-daily if weight <80\u2009kg or thrice-daily if weight >80\u2009kg). Neflamapimod does not show an effect in the clinical study on the primary endpoint, a cognitive-test battery. On two secondary endpoints, a measure of functional mobility and a dementia rating-scale, improvements were seen that are consistent with an effect on BFCN function. Neflamapimod treatment is well-tolerated with no study drug associated treatment discontinuations. The combined preclinical and clinical observations inform on the validity of the Rab5-based pathogenic model of cholinergic degeneration and provide a foundation for confirmatory (hypothesis-testing) clinical evaluation of neflamapimod in DLB.",

An important potential future use for ATN is therapeutic decision-making in clinical practice once disease-modifying treatments, e.g., anti-amyloid, become widely available. In this cross-sectional study, we applied ATN and estimated potential eligibility for anti-amyloid treatment in a real-life memory clinic with biomarker assessments integrated into the routine diagnostic procedure and all specialized resources available for the implementation of novel treatments.We included all consecutive patients at the Karolinska University Hospital Memory clinic in Solna, Stockholm, Sweden, who had their first diagnostic visit in April 2018-February 2021, informed consent for the clinic research database, and available clinical and biomarker (CSF, imaging) data. ATN classification was based on CSF A\u03b242 (or A\u03b242/40; A), CSF phosphorylated tau (T), and medial temporal lobe atrophy (N). For CSF markers, we applied laboratory cut-offs and data-driven cut-offs for comparison (determined with Gaussian mixture modelling). Anti-amyloid treatment eligibility was assessed following the published recommendations for aducanumab (AD dementia or MCI with no evidence of non-AD etiology, appropriate level of cognition, AD-consistent CSF profile).Study population consisted of 410 patients (52% subjective cognitive impairment, 23% mild cognitive impairment MCI, 25% any dementia; age 59\u00b17 years, 56% women). Regardless of biomarker cut-offs, most patients were A-T-N- (54-57%). A+ prevalence was 17-30% (higher with data-driven cut-offs). Up to 13% of all patients (27% of those with MCI and 28% of those with dementia) were potentially eligible for anti-amyloid treatment when AD-consistent CSF was defined as any A+ profile. When A+T+ profile was required, treatment was targeted more to the dementia than MCI stage (eligibility up to 14% in MCI, 22% in dementia). The opposite applied to earlier stage intervention (A+T-N-; eligibility up to 12% in MCI, 2% in dementia).In a memory clinic setting with all necessary infrastructure and national guidelines in place for dementia diagnostic examination (\"best-case scenario\"), most patients did not meet the eligibility criteria for anti-amyloid treatment.

Policies have been proposed more generally, but their benefits for brain health have yet to be fully explored.Over the course of two years, we worked as a consortium of 20+ academics in a participatory and consensus method to develop the first policy agenda for mitigating air pollution's impact on brain health and dementia, including an umbrella review and engaging 11 stakeholder organisations.We identified three policy domains and 14 priority areas. Research and Funding included: (1) embracing a complexities of place approach that (2) highlights vulnerable populations; (3) details the impact of ambient PM2.5 on brain health, including current and historical high-resolution exposure models; (4) emphasises the importance of indoor air pollution; (5) catalogues the multiple pathways to disease for brain health and dementia, including those most at risk; (6) embraces a life course perspective; and (7) radically rethinks funding. Education and Awareness included: (8) making this unrecognised public health issue known; (9) developing educational products; (10) attaching air pollution and brain health to existing strategies and campaigns; and (11) providing publicly available monitoring, assessment and screening tools. Policy Evaluation included: (12) conducting complex systems evaluation; (13) engaging in co-production; and (14) evaluating air quality policies for their brain health benefits.Given the pressing issues of brain health, dementia and air pollution, setting a policy agenda is crucial. Policy needs to be matched by scientific evidence and appropriate guidelines, including bespoke strategies to optimise impact and mitigate unintended consequences.

Also, we analyze B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire data generated from a public dataset of three normal and 10 AD samples and perform BCR repertoire profiling and pairwise sharing analysis.

Patients with AD share similar class-switched BCR sequences with identical isotypes, despite the high somatic hypermutation rate.

        "ArticleAbstract": "In response to brain insults, astrocytes become reactive, promoting protection and tissue repair. However, astroglial reactivity is typical of brain pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering the heterogeneity of the reactive response, the role of astrocytes in the course of different forms of AD has been underestimated. Colombia has the largest human group known to have familial AD (FAD). This group carries the autosomal dominant and fully penetrant mutation E280A in PSEN1, which causes early-onset AD. Recently, our group identified an E280A carrier who did not develop FAD. The individual was homozygous for the Christchurch mutation R136S in APOE3 (APOEch). Remarkably, APOE is the main genetic risk factor for developing sporadic AD (SAD) and most of cerebral ApoE is produced by astroglia. Here, we characterized astrocyte properties related to reactivity, glutamate homeostasis, and structural integrity of the gliovascular unit (GVU), as factors that could underlie the pathogenesis or protection of AD. Specifically, through histological and 3D microscopy analyses of postmortem samples, we briefly describe the histopathology and cytoarchitecture of the frontal cortex of SAD, FAD, and APOEch, and demonstrate that, while astrodegeneration and vascular deterioration are prominent in SAD, FAD is characterized by hyperreactive-like glia, and APOEch displays the mildest astrocytic and vascular alterations despite having the highest burden of A\u03b2. Notably, astroglial, gliovascular, and vascular disturbances, as well as brain cell death, correlate with the specific astrocytic phenotypes identified in each condition. This study provides new insights into the potential relevance of the gliovasculature in the development and protection of AD.

Transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated lysosome biogenesis enhances lysosome-dependent degradation and alleviates neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms underlying TFEB regulation and modification are still poorly understood.By screening novel small-molecule compounds, we identified a group of lysosome-enhancing compounds (LYECs) that promote TFEB activation and lysosome biogenesis.One of these compounds, LH2-051, significantly inhibited the function of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and subsequently promoted lysosome biogenesis. We uncovered cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as a novel regulator of DAT-mediated lysosome biogenesis and identified six novel CDK9-phosphorylated sites on TFEB. We observed that signal transduction by the DAT-CDK9-TFEB axis occurs on lysosomes. Finally, we found that LH2-051 enhanced the degradation of amyloid beta plaques and improved the memory of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Presenilin 1 (PS1) mice.We identified the DAT-CDK9-TFEB signaling axis as a novel regulator of lysosome biogenesis.

Our lab previously reported that caspase-2 protein levels are elevated in these diseases, leading us to hypothesize that elevated caspase-2 protein levels are due to increased transcription of caspase-2 mRNA. There are two major isoforms of caspase-2 mRNA, caspase-2L and caspase-2S. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the levels of these mRNA isoforms normalized to levels of RPL13 mRNA, a reference gene that showed no disease-associated changes. Here, we report no increases in caspase-2L mRNA levels in any of the three diseases studied, AD (with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), HD and LBD, disproving our hypothesis. Caspase-2S mRNA showed a non-significant downward trend in AD. We also analyzed expression levels of SNAP25 and \u03b2III-tubulin mRNA. SNAP25 mRNA was significantly lower in AD and there were downward trends in MCI, LBD, and HD. \u03b2III-tubulin mRNA expression remained unchanged between disease groups and controls. These findings indicate that factors besides transcriptional regulation cause increases in caspase-2 protein levels. The reduction of SNAP25 mRNA expression suggests that presynaptic dysfunction contributes to cognitive deficits in neurodegeneration.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Evaluating Web-Based Automatic Transcription for Alzheimer Speech Data: Transcript Comparison and Machine Learning Analysis.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Speech data for medical research can be collected noninvasively and in large volumes. Speech analysis has shown promise in diagnosing neurodegenerative disease. To effectively leverage speech data, transcription is important, as there is valuable information contained in lexical content. Manual transcription, while highly accurate, limits the potential scalability and cost savings associated with language-based screening.To better understand the use of automatic transcription for classification of neurodegenerative disease, namely, Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or subjective memory complaints (SMC) versus healthy controls, we compared automatically generated transcripts against transcripts that went through manual correction.We recruited individuals from a memory clinic (\"patients\") with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD, (n=44, 30%), MCI (n=20, 13%), SMC (n=8, 5%), as well as healthy controls (n=77, 52%) living in the community. Participants were asked to describe a standardized picture, read a paragraph, and recall a pleasant life experience. We compared transcripts generated using Google speech-to-text software to manually verified transcripts by examining transcription confidence scores, transcription error rates, and machine learning classification accuracy. For the classification tasks, logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, and random forests were used.The transcription software showed higher confidence scores (P<.001) and lower error rates (P>.05) for speech from healthy controls compared with patients. Classification models using human-verified transcripts significantly (P<.001) outperformed automatically generated transcript models for both spontaneous speech tasks. This comparison showed no difference in the reading task. Manually adding pauses to transcripts had no impact on classification performance. However, manually correcting both spontaneous speech tasks led to significantly higher performances in the machine learning models.We found that automatically transcribed speech data could be used to distinguish patients with a diagnosis of AD, MCI, or SMC from controls. We recommend a human verification step to improve the performance of automatic transcripts, especially for spontaneous tasks. Moreover, human verification can focus on correcting errors and adding punctuation to transcripts. However, manual addition of pauses is not needed, which can simplify the human verification step to more efficiently process large volumes of speech data.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most common cause of dementia among the elderly. One of the modifiable causes of AD is neuroinflammation. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of new tricyclic 1,2-thiazine derivatives on in vitro model of neuroinflammation and their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).The potential anti-inflammatory effect of new tricyclic 1,2-thiazine derivatives\u00a0(TP1, TP4, TP5, TP6, TP7, TP8, TP9, TP10) was assessed in SH-SY5Y cells differentiated to the neuron-like phenotype incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (5 or 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) or THP-1 microglial cell culture supernatant using MTT, DCF-DA, Griess, and fast halo (FHA) assays. Additionally, for cultures preincubated with 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cyclooxygenase (COX) activity assay was performed. Finally, the potential ability of tested compounds to cross the BBB was evaluated by computational studies. Molecular docking was performed with the TLR4/MD-2 complex to assess the possibility of binding the tested compounds in the LPS binding pocket. Prediction of ADMET parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) was also conducted.The unfavorable effect of LPS and co-culture with THP-1 cells on neuronal cell viability was counteracted with TP1 and TP4 in all tested concentrations. Tested compounds reduced the oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by both LPS and microglia activation and also reduced DNA damage. Furthermore, new derivatives inhibited total COX activity. Additionally, new compounds would cross the BBB with high probability and reach concentrations in the brain not lower than in the serum. The binding affinity at the TLR4/MD-2 complex binding site of TP4 and TP8 compounds is similar to that of the drug donepezil used in Alzheimer's disease. The ADMET analysis showed that the tested compounds should not be toxic and should show high intestinal absorption.New tricyclic 1,2-thiazine derivatives exert a neuroregenerative effect in the neuroinflammation model, presumably via their inhibitory influence on COX activity and reduction of oxidative and nitrosative stress.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Hypertension affects a significant proportion of the adult and aging population and represents an important risk factor for vascular cognitive impairment and late-life dementia. Chronic high blood pressure continuously challenges the structural and functional integrity of the cerebral vasculature, leading to microvascular rarefaction and dysfunction, and neurovascular uncoupling that typically impairs cerebral blood supply. Hypertension disrupts blood-brain barrier integrity, promotes neuroinflammation, and may contribute to amyloid deposition and Alzheimer pathology. The mechanisms underlying these harmful effects are still a focus of investigation, but studies in animal models have provided significant molecular and cellular mechanistic insights. Remaining questions relate to whether adequate treatment of hypertension may prevent deterioration of cognitive function, the threshold for blood pressure treatment, and the most effective antihypertensive drugs. Recent advances in neurovascular biology, advanced brain imaging, and detection of subtle behavioral phenotypes have begun to provide insights into these critical issues. Importantly, a parallel analysis of these parameters in animal models and humans is feasible, making it possible to foster translational advancements. In this review, we provide a critical evaluation of the evidence available in experimental models and humans to examine the progress made and identify remaining gaps in knowledge.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Background Gait is a complex task requiring coordinated efforts of multiple brain networks. To date, there is little evidence on whether gait is altered in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We aimed to identify impairments in gait performance and associations between gait impairment and neuroimaging markers of CAA, cognition, and falls. Methods and Results Gait was assessed using the Zeno Walkway during preferred pace and dual task walks, and grouped into gait domains (Rhythm, Pace, Postural Control, and Variability). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Falls and fear of falling were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Gait domain scores were standardized and analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, height, and other covariates. Participants were patients with CAA (n=29), Alzheimer disease with mild dementia (n=16), mild cognitive impairment (n=24), and normal elderly controls (n=47). CAA and Alzheimer disease had similarly impaired Rhythm, Pace, and Variability, and higher dual task cost than normal controls or mild cognitive impairment. Higher Pace score was associated with better global cognition, processing speed, and memory. Gait measures were not correlated with microbleed count or white matter hyperintensity volume. Number of falls was not associated with gait domain scores, but participants with low fear of falling had higher Pace (odds ratio [OR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.59-4.29]) and lower Variability (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.44]). Conclusions CAA is associated with slower walking, abnormal rhythm, and greater gait variability than in healthy controls. Future research is needed to identify the mechanisms underlying gait impairments in CAA, and whether they predict future falls.",

At the baseline (2014) and follow-up (2018) examinations, sleep parameters were assessed using standard questionnaires. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Dementia was diagnosed following the DSM-IV criteria, and the NIA-AA criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD). Data were analyzed using restricted cubic splines, Cox proportional-hazards models, and general linear models.During the mean follow-up of 3.7\u2009years, dementia was diagnosed in 97 participants (68 with AD). Restricted cubic spline curves showed J-shaped associations of sleep duration, TIB, and rise time with dementia risk, and a reverse J-shaped association with mid-sleep time. When sleep parameters were categorized into tertiles, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of incident dementia was 1.69 (95%CI 1.01-2.83) for baseline sleep duration >8\u2009hours (vs. 7-8\u2009h), 2.17 (1.22-3.87) for bedtime before 9\u2009p.m. (vs. 10\u2009p.m. or later), and 2.00 (1.23-3.24) for mid-sleep time before 1\u2009a.m. (vs. 1-1.5\u2009a.m.). Early bedtime and mid-sleep time were significantly associated with incident AD (HR range: 2.25-2.51; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Among individuals who were free of dementia at follow-up, baseline long TIB, early bedtime and mid-sleep time, early and late rise time, and prolonged TIB and advanced bedtime and mid-sleep time from baseline to follow-up were associated with a greater decline in MMSE score (p\u2009<\u20090.05). These associations with cognitive decline were statistically evident mainly among men or participants who were aged 60-74\u2009years.Long TIB and early sleep timing are associated with an increased risk of dementia, and the associations with greater cognitive decline are evident only among older people aged 60-74\u2009years and men.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "\u03b2-Amyloid (A\u03b2) protein is a pivotal pathogenetic factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, increasing evidence suggests that the brain has to continuously produce excessive A\u03b2 to efficaciously prevent pathogenic micro-organism infections, which induces and accelerates the disease process of AD. Meanwhile, A\u03b2 exhibits activity against herpes simplex virus type\u00a01 (HSV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV) replication, but not against other neurotropic viruses. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the most important neurotropic enterovirus in the post-polio era. Given the limitation of existing research on the relationship between A\u03b2 and other virus infections, this study aimed to investigate the potent activity of A\u03b2 on EV-A71 infection and extended the potential function of A\u03b2 in other unenveloped viruses may be linked to Alzheimer's disease or infectious neurological diseases.A\u03b2 peptides 1-42 are a major pathological factor of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, we utilized A\u03b21-42 as a test subject to perform our study. The production of monomer A\u03b21-42 and their high-molecular oligomer accumulations in neural cells were detected by immunofluorescence assay, ELISA, or Western blot assay. The inhibitory activity of A\u03b21-42 peptides against EV-A71 in vitro was detected by Western blot analysis or qRT-PCR. The mechanism of A\u03b21-42 against EV-A71 replication was analyzed by time-of-addition assay, attachment inhibition assay, pre-attachment inhibition analysis, viral-penetration inhibition assay, TEM analysis of virus agglutination, and pull-down assay.We found that EV-A71 infection induced A\u03b2 production and accumulation in SH-SY5Y cells. We also revealed for the first time that A\u03b21-42 efficiently inhibited the RNA level of EV-A71 VP1, and the protein levels of VP1, VP2, and nonstructural protein 3AB in SH-SY5Y, Vero, and human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that A\u03b21-42 primarily targeted the early stage of EV-A71 entry to inhibit virus replication by binding virus capsid protein VP1 or scavenger receptor class B member 2. Moreover, A\u03b21-42 formed non-enveloped EV-A71 particle aggregates within a certain period and bound to the capsid protein VP1, which partially caused A\u03b21-42 to prevent viruses from infecting cells.Our findings unveiled that A\u03b21-42 effectively inhibited nonenveloped EV-A71 by targeting the early phase of an EV-A71 life cycle, thereby extending the potential function of A\u03b2 in other non-envelope viruses linked to infectious neurological diseases.",

This widely localized enzyme has been involved in the pathophysiology of several diseases. More recently, PTP1B has attracted attention in the field of neuroscience, since its activation in brain cells can lead to schizophrenia-like behaviour deficits, anxiety-like effects, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and depression. Conversely, PTP1B inhibition has been shown to prevent microglial activation, thus exerting a potent anti-inflammatory effect and has also shown potential to increase the cognitive process through the stimulation of hippocampal insulin, leptin and BDNF/TrkB receptors. Notwithstanding, most research on the clinical efficacy of targeting PTP1B has been developed in the field of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (TD2M). However, despite the link existing between these metabolic alterations and neurodegeneration, no clinical trials assessing the neurological advantages of PTP1B inhibition have been performed yet. Preclinical studies, though, have provided strong evidence that targeting PTP1B could allow to reach different pathophysiological mechanisms at once. herefore, specific interventions or trials should be designed to modulate PTP1B activity in brain, since it is a promising strategy to decelerate or prevent neurodegeneration in aged individuals, among other neurological diseases. The present paper fails to include all neurological conditions in which PTP1B could have a role; instead, it focuses on those which have been related to metabolic alterations and neurodegenerative processes. Moreover, only preclinical data is discussed, since clinical studies on the potential of PTP1B inhibition for treating neurological diseases are still required.",

Biomarkers derived from DNA methylation (DNAm) offer potential mechanistic insights into human health differences, connecting disease pathogenesis and biological ageing. However, little is known about sensitive periods during the life course where air pollution might have a stronger impact on DNAm, or whether effects accumulate over time. We examined associations between air pollution exposure across the life course and DNAm-based markers of biological ageing.Data were derived from the Scotland-based Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Participants' residential history was linked to annual levels of fine particle (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) around 1935, 1950, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2001; pollutant concentrations were estimated using the EMEP4UK atmospheric chemistry transport model. Blood samples were obtained between ages of 70 and 80\u00a0years, and Horvath DNAmAge, Hannum DNAmAge, DNAmPhenoAge, DNAmGrimAge, and DNAm telomere length (DNAmTL) were computed. We applied the structured life-course modelling approach: least angle regression identified best-fit life-course models for a composite measure of air pollution (air quality index [AQI]), and mixed-effects regression estimated selected models for AQI and single pollutants.We included 525 individuals with 1782 observations. In the total sample, increased air pollution around 1970 was associated with higher epigenetic age (AQI: b\u00a0=\u00a00.322\u00a0year, 95\u00a0%CI: 0.088, 0.555) measured with Horvath DNAmAge in late adulthood. We found shorter DNAmTL among males with higher air pollution around 1980 (AQI: b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.015 kilobase, 95\u00a0%CI: -0.027, -0.004) and among females with higher exposure around 1935 (AQI: b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.017 kilobase, 95\u00a0%CI: -0.028, -0.006). Findings were more consistent for the pollutants PM2.5, SO2 and NO2.We tested the life-course relationship between air pollution and DNAm-based biomarkers.

For this slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease so far no disease modifying therapy exists.To find out if non-pharmacologic non-ivasive neuromodulatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may offer a new alternative or an add on therapeutic strategy against loss of cognitive functions.In this exploratory intervention study safety and symptom development before and after frontopolar cortex stimulation (FPC) using intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) at 10 subsequent working days was monitored as add-on treatment in 28 consecutive patients with AD. Out of these, 10 randomly selected patients received sham stimulation as a control. In addition, \u200bserum concentrations of neurotransmitter precursor amino acids, of immune activation and inflammation markers, of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as well as of nitrite were measured.Treatment was well tolerated, no serious adverse effects were observed. Improvement of cognition was detected by an increase of Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSE; p<0.01, paired rank test) and also by an increase in a modified repeat address phrase test, part of the 6-item cognitive \u200bimpairment test (p < 0.01). A trend to an increase in the clock drawing test (CDT; p = 0.08) was also found in the verum treated group. Furtheron, in 10 of the AD patients with additional symptoms of depression treated with iTBS, a significant decrease in the HAMD-7 scale (p <0.01) and a trend to lower serum phenylalanine concentrations (p = 0.08) was seen. No changes of the parameters tested were found in the sham treated patients.Our preliminary results may indicate that iTBS is effective in the treatment of AD. Also a slight influence of iTBS on the metabolism of phenylalanine was found after 10 iTBS sessions. An impact of iTBS to influence the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), as found in previous series of treatment resistant depression, could not be seen in this our first observational trial in 10 AD patients with comorbidity of depression. Longer treatment periods for several weeks in a higher number of AD patients with depression could cause more intense and disease modifying effects visible in different neurotransmitter concentrations important in the pathogenesis of AD.",

A\u03b242 oligomer rather than monomer is toxic to neuronal cells and can directly bind to LilrB2, resulting in synaptic loss and cognitive impairment in the development of AD. Therefore, uncovering the mechanism of interaction between A\u03b242 oligomer and LilrB2 becomes the first step to obtain a clear drug target and specific binding sites. Herein, a tetracoordinated mechanism for the A\u03b2 oligomer-LilrB2 binding was first put forward by employing A\u03b242 dimer mimic-antiparallel copies of A\u03b242 core fragment 16KLVFFA21, to bind LilrB2 as models, in which four key residues (F5/F6/L12/F14) in the A\u03b242 mimic are bound strongly with LilrB2 residue(s) or accommodated by four hydrophobic cavities in LilrB2 to generate a stable complex. Bi-dentate binding, however, cannot keep the complex A\u03b242 mimic-LilrB2 stable. The inhibitor fluspirilene can disturb the binding of four key residues of A\u03b242 to LilrB2, justifying the tetracoordinated zipper mechanism on the other hand.",

Even though their roles are widely investigated in pathological conditions, information on the presence and functions of A\u03b2 and \u03b1-syn in mitochondria in endogenous levels is somewhat limited. We hypothesized that endogenous A\u03b2 fragments or \u03b1-syn could interact with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) directly or influence RNAs or transcription factors in mitochondria and change the mtDNA transcription profile. In this review, we summarized clues of these possible interactions.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "In this study, new graphene-based IMAC nanocomposites for phosphopeptide enrichment were prepared according to the guideline of our new design strategy. Superhydrophilic polyethyleneimine (PEI) was introduced, to which a phosphonate-functionalized ionic liquid (PFIL) was covalently bound, to form superhydrophilic and cationic surface layers with high densities of nitrogen atoms, phosphonate functional groups, and high-loading metal ions. Due to the combined features of superhydrophilicity, flexibility, highly dense metal binding sites, large surface area and excellent size-exclusion effect, the fabricated nanocomposite G@mSiO2@PEI-PFIL-Ti4+ exhibits superior detection sensitivity to enrich phosphopeptides (tryptic \u03b2-casein digest, 0.1 fmol), and extraordinary enrichment specificity to enrich phosphopeptides from a digest mixture of \u03b2-casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (molar ratio, 1\u2009:\u200912\u2009000). The excellent size-exclusion effect was also observed, and 27 endogenous phosphopeptides were identified in human saliva. All these results could be attributed to the unique superhydrophilic nanocomposite structure with a high density of a cationic linker modified with phosphonate functionality. Moreover, G@mSiO2@PEI-PFIL-Ti4+ adsorbents were used to extract phosphopeptides from the tryptic digests of hippocampal lysates for quantitative phosphoproteome analysis. The preliminary results indicate that 1649 phosphoproteins, 3286 phosphopeptides and 4075 phosphorylation sites were identified. A total of 13 Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related phosphopeptides within tau proteins were detected with a wide coverage from p-Thr111 to p-Ser404, in which the amounts of some phoshopeptides at certain sites in AD transgenic mice were found statistically higher than those in wild type littermates. Besides, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains, a potential biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and traumatic brain injury, were also identified. Finally, the adsorbent was applied to human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples. 5 unique phosphopeptides of neuroendocrine specific VGF were identified in the CSF, while many phosphopeptides originated from the nervous system were found in the blood sample. All these results suggest that our new IMAC materials exhibit unbiased enrichment ability with superior detection sensitivity and specificity, allowing the global phosphoproteome analysis of complicated biological samples more convincible and indicating the potential use in disease diagnosis.",

        "ArticleTitle": "[Correlation of muscle strength with cognitive function and medial temporal lobe atrophy in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease].",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Objective: To analyze the correlation of muscle strength with cognitive function and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: General information, sarcopenia-related indicators, neuropsychological tests and MTA score were collected in 80 confirmed AD patients (41 mild and 39 moderate patients) and 43 normal controls (NC) from the Memory Disorders Clinic of Department Of Neurology in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between January and December 2021. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), grip strength and 5-times sit-to-stand time and 6-m gait speed were used for assessing muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function, respectively. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Memory and Executive Screening Scale (MES), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Digital Span Test (DST) and Verbal Fluency Task (VFT), respectively. DST included Forward Digit Span Test (FDST) and Backward Digit Span Test (BDST). All the subjects underwent 3.0T coronal three-dimensional gradient echo sequence MRI. MTA scale was performed to evaluate the degree of medial temporal lobe atrophy. The differences in the sarcopenia-related indicators, cognitive score and MTA score were analyzed among the three groups, and the partial correlation analysis was performed between the inter-groups. Results: Eighty AD patients (24 males and 56 females) were included, aged (72\u00b17) years old, with 41 mild and 39 moderate patients. Meanwhile, 43 NC included 19 males and 24 females, with a mean age of (70\u00b16) years old. The disease duration in moderate AD patients was longer than that of mild AD patients [34.0 (25.0, 43.5) months vs 24.0 (11.0, 34.0) months, P<0.001]. The differences of sarcopenia-related indicators and MTA score among the three groups were statistically significant (all P<0.001), including 5-times sit-to-stand time [(13.6\u00b11.8) s vs (11.5\u00b11.7) s vs (10.3\u00b11.9) s, P<0.001] and MTA score [2.0 (2.0, 3.0) vs 1.0 (1.0, 2.0) vs 0 (0, 0), P<0.001]. In neuropsychological tests, compared to the NC group, MMSE, MoCA, MES and VFT scores in mild and moderate AD groups were lower (all P<0.001); meanwhile, compared to the mild AD group, the moderate group had lower MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST and VFT scores (all P<0.001). In sarcopenia-related indicators, muscle strength in particular was correlated with widespread cognitive functioning domains and MTA score in AD patients. Grip strength was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA , MES, FDST (r=0.387, 0.418, 0.522 and 0.484, respectively, all P<0.001), DSST (r=0.327, P=0.006) and VFT score (r=0.354, P=0.003), and negatively correlated with MTA score (r=-0.631, P<0.001). 5-times sit-to-stand time was negatively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST, VFT score (r=-0.583, -0.587, -0.814, -0.591, -0.552 and -0.485, respectively, all P<0.001), and BDST (r=-0.355, P=0.003) strongly positively correlated with MTA score (r=0.836, P<0.001). ASMI was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST score (r=0.257, 0.238, 0.428, 0.282 and 0.364, respectively, all P<0.05), and negatively correlated with MTA score (r=-0.377, P=0.001). 6-m gait speed was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST score (r=0.419, 0.486, 0.699, 0.559 and 0.500, respectively, all P<0.001), BDST and VFT score (r=0.384\u30010.377, respectively, both P=0.001), and strongly negatively correlated with MTA score (r=-0.803, P<0.001). Conclusions: Patients with mild to moderate AD have widespread cognitive impairment. Muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function are all significantly impaired. Compared to muscle mass and physical function, decreased muscle strength is significantly associated with widespread cognitive decline and increased degree of medial temporal lobe atrophy.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neuronal apoptosis is an important factor in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aerobic exercise (AE) enhances learning and memory, improves cognitive impairment, increases telomere binding protein expression, and decreases apoptosis regulators, but it remains unclear whether it can improve cognitive impairment caused by neuronal apoptosis in AD. Therefore, this study investigated whether an 8-week running table exercise intervention could reduce apoptosis and improve cognitive function in the hippocampal neurons of AD model mice. After the exercise intervention, we evaluated the learning memory ability (positioning, navigation, and spatial search) of mice using a Morris water labyrinth, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and protein application to detect hippocampal PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling pathway protein and hippocampal neuronal cell apoptosis protein B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and apoptosis-promoting protein bcl-2-related X (Bax) protein expression. The results showed that aerobic exercise improved the location and spatial exploration ability of mice, increased the number of PI3K- and p-Akt-positive cells, increased the expression of PI3K, p-Akt, and bcl-2 proteins, decreased the expression of GSK-3\u03b2 and Bax proteins, and increased the bcl-2/Bax ratio of mice. The results suggest that aerobic exercise can reduce apoptosis and improve cognitive function in AD mice. The molecular mechanism may involve activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling pathway.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Geriatric symptoms are common in dementia cases, while few studies have focused on these symptoms in Lewy body dementia (LBD). The purpose of this study is to investigate the distributions of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 and geriatric symptoms, and explore their associaitons in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).A retrospective study with 185 mild-moderate probable DLB (n\u2009=\u200993) and PDD (n\u2009=\u200992) patients was assigned. Demographic and clinical characteristics, neuropsychological assessments, and APOE genotypes were recorded. Description, correlation and logistic regression models were used to analyze the presence of geriatric symptom complaints and their associations with APOE \u03b54.DLB patients displayed more frequency of fluctuating cognition, visual hallucination, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, delusion, depression, anxiety, apathy, and loss of appetite, whereas the PDD cases had constipation, fear of falling, and insomnia more frequently. The APOE \u03b54 allele was more common in DLB than PDD (29.9% vs. 7.0%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and the patients with DLB\u2009+\u2009APOE \u03b54 (+) were presented more delusions (p\u2009=\u20090.005) and apathy (p\u2009=\u20090.007) than patients with PDD\u2009+\u2009APOE \u03b54 (+). We also found that the APOE \u03b54 allele was significantly associated with hyperhidrosis (OR\u2009=\u20093.472, 95%CI: 1.082-11.144, p\u2009=\u20090.036) and depression (OR\u2009=\u20093.002, 95%CI: 1.079-8.353, p\u2009=\u20090.035) in DLB patients, while there were no significant associations between APOE \u03b54 allele and the age at visit, the age at onset, scores of MDS-UPDRS III, H&Y stage, ADL, MMSE, MOCA and NPI, as well as the presences of fluctuating cognition, VH, parkinsonism and RBD in both groups.The presence and co-incidence of geriatric symptoms are common in patients with mild-moderate LBD. The presence of APOE \u03b54 allele is associated with hyperhidrosis and depression, but not global cognition, activitives of daily life, motor function and other neuropsychitric symptoms in DLB. These findings improve the awareness of geriatric symptoms, and contribute to the healthcare management of mild-moderate DLB and PDD.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) represent two different pathologies, they have clinical overlap, and there is a significant degree of co-occurrence of their neuropathological findings. Many studies have examined imaging characteristics in clinically diagnosed patients; however, there is a relative lack of longitudinal studies that have studied patients with pathological confirmation. We examined whether there were differences in longitudinal patterns of cortical atrophy between patients with both AD and DLB (AD/DLB) vs. those with AD alone.We collected and analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for patients who underwent autopsy. The rates of change in various neuropsychological assessments were not significantly different between AD/DLB and AD patients, and each group had neuropsychological outcomes consistent with disease progression. For our neuroimaging analysis, we used a linear mixed effects model to examine if there were longitudinal differences in cortical rates of atrophy between AD/DLB and AD patients.Autopsies and serial neuroimaging was available on 48 patients (24 AD, 24 AD/DLB). Patients with AD alone had significantly higher atrophy rates in the left cuneus, lateral occipital, and parahippocampal regions over time when compared to patients with concomitant DLB, after covarying for interval from imaging to autopsy, gender, and total estimated intracranial volume (eTIV). Site ID was included as a random effect to account for site differences. For these regions, the rate of decline over time in the AD/DLB group were less steep by a difference of 0.1887, 0.395, and 0.0989, respectively (p =.022, .006, and .006). The lattermost left cuneus volume measurement also positively correlated to Braak Lewy score (Pearson's product-moment correlation 0.37, p=.009), while the lattermost left parahippocampal volume measurement negatively correlated to Braak NFT score (Pearson's product-moment correlation -0.327, p=.02).AD patients had more significant atrophy in the left cuneus, lateral occipital, and parahippocampal regions when compared to AD/DLB patients. These regions are known to distinguish DLB and AD pathology cross-sectionally, but here are shown to distinguish longitudinal disease progression.",

Alterations to this system may play a pivotal role in amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation. However, its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the changes in noninvasive MRI measurements related to the perivascular network in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Additionally, we explored the associations of MRI measures with neuropsychological score, PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and A\u03b2 deposition.MRI measures, including perivascular space (PVS) volume fraction (PVSVF), fractional volume of free water in white matter (FW-WM), and index of diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS index) of patients with MCI, those with AD, and healthy controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were compared. MRI measures were also correlated with the levels of CSF biomarkers, PET SUVR, and cognitive score in the combined subcohort of patients with MCI and AD. Statistical analyses were performed with age, sex, years of education, and APOE status as confounding factors.In total, 36 patients with AD, 44 patients with MCI, and 31 healthy controls were analyzed. Patients with AD had significantly higher total, WM, and basal ganglia PVSVF (Cohen's d = 1.15-1.48; p < 0.001), and FW-WM (Cohen's d = 0.73; p < 0.05) and a lower ALPS index (Cohen's d = 0.63; p < 0.05) than healthy controls. Meanwhile, the MCI group only showed significantly higher total (Cohen's d = 0.99; p < 0.05) and WM (Cohen's d = 0.91; p < 0.05) PVSVF. Low ALPS index was associated with lower CSF A\u03b242 (r  = 0.41, p  = 0.026), FDG-PET uptake (r  = 0.54, p  < 0.001), and worse multiple cognitive domain deficits. High FW-WM was also associated with lower CSF A\u03b242 (r  = -0.47, p  = 0.021) and worse cognitive performances.Our study indicates that changes in PVS-related MRI parameters occur in MCI and AD, possibly due to impairment of the glymphatic system.

Recently, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was reported as an important enzyme, whose activity can provide predictive value for timely discovery and diagnosis of AD. Therefore, it is indispensable to design a detection tool for selective and rapid response toward BChE. In this study, we developed a novel near-infrared fluorescent probe () for the detection of BChE activity. An excellent sensitivity, good biocompatibility, and lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.12 ng/mL made the probe extremely specific for BChE, which was successfully used in biological imaging. What is more,  can not only clearly distinguish tumor from normal cells but also forms a clear boundary between the normal and cancer tissues due to the obvious difference in fluorescence intensity produced via in situ spraying. Most important of all,  was also successfully applied to track the BChE activity in AD mouse models.

CREAD (194 sites in 30 countries) and CREAD2 (209 sites in 27 countries) were global multicenter studies. A total of 3736 and 3664 participants were screened in CREAD and CREAD2, respectively. A total of 3736 and 3664 participants were screened in CREAD and CREAD2, respectively. Both trials enrolled individuals aged 50 to 85 years with early AD. Participants with some comorbidities and evidence of cerebral infarction or more than 4 microbleeds or areas of leptomeningeal hemosiderosis on magnetic resonance imaging were excluded. After 2923 and 2858 were excluded, respectively, 813 participants in CREAD and 806 in CREAD2 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either placebo or crenezumab. In the final analysis, there were 409 participants in the placebo group and 404 in the crenezumab group in CREAD and 399 in the placebo group and 407 in the crenezumab group in CREAD2. Data were analyzed up until January 2019 and August 2019, respectively.Participants received placebo or 60 mg/kg crenezumab intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 100 weeks.The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 105 in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score.There were 813 participants in CREAD (mean [SD] age, 70.7 [8.2] years; 483 female and 330 male) and 806 in CREAD2 (mean [SD] age, 70.9 [7.7] years; 456 female and 350 male).

Mounting studies indicate that parameters related to sarcopenia are associated with AD, but some results show inconsistent.

Parameters related to sarcopenia include appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), grip strength, 5-times sit-to-stand (5-STS) time and 6-m gait speed. The GMV of each cerebral region of interest (ROI) and the intracranial volume were calculated by computing the numbers of the voxels in the specific region based on MRI data. Partial correlation and multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis explored the correlation between different inter-group GMV ratios in ROIs and parameters related to sarcopenia, adjusting for covariates.The 82 participants included 40 NC aged 70.13\u2009\u00b1\u20095.94\u00a0years, 24 mild AD patients aged 73.54\u2009\u00b1\u20098.27\u00a0years and 18 moderate AD patients aged 71.67\u2009\u00b1\u20099.39\u00a0years. Multivariate stepwise linear regression showed that 5-STS time and gait speed were correlated with bilateral hippocampus volume ratios in total AD. Grip strength was associated with the GMV ratio of the left middle frontal gyrus in mild AD and the GMV ratios of the right superior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus in moderate AD. However, ASMI did not have a relationship to any cerebral GMV ratio.Among parameters related to sarcopenia, 5-STS time and gait speed were associated with bilateral hippocampus volume ratios at different clinical stages of patients with AD.

It has been widely used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).To capture the anatomical changes in the brain caused by AD/MCI, deep learning-based MRI image analysis methods have been proposed in recent years. However, it is observed that the performance of most existing methods is limited as they only construct a single type of deep network and ignore the significance of other clinical\u00a0information.To make up for these defects, an ensemble framework that incorporates three types of dedicatedly-designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network is proposed, where three CNNs with entropy-based multi-instance learning pooling layers have more reliable feature selection abilities. The dedicatedly-designed base classifiers can make use of the heterogeneous data, and empower the framework with enhanced diversity and robustness. In particular, to consider the interactions among the base classifiers, a novel multi-head self-attention voting scheme is designed. Moreover, considering the chance that MCI can be transformed to AD, the proposed framework is designed to diagnose AD and predict MCI conversion simultaneously, with the aid of the transfer learning technique.For performance evaluation and comparison, extensive experiments are conducted on the public dataset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The results show that the proposed ensemble framework provides superior performance under most of the evaluation metrics. Especially, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy (98.61% for the AD diagnosis task, and 84.49% for the MCI conversion prediction task).These promising results demonstrate the proposed ensemble framework can accurately diagnose AD patients and predict the conversion of MCI patients, which has the potential of clinical practice for diagnosing AD and\u00a0MCI.",

We map the GSM binding site to the enzyme-substrate interface, define a drug-binding mode that is consistent with functional and structural data, and provide molecular insights into the underlying mechanisms of action. In this respect, our analyses show that occupancy of a \u03b3-secretase (sub)pocket, mediating binding of the modulator's imidazole moiety, is sufficient to trigger allosteric rearrangements in \u03b3-secretase as well as stabilize enzyme-substrate interactions.

Rates of progression to MCI/dementia or to DRS \u2264129 were faster for all subgroups (Low-All Domains progressed the fastest\u200a>\u200aLow Memory/Language\u2265Low-Visuospatial and Low-Executive) relative to the All-Average subgroup.Faster progression in the Low-Visuospatial, Low-Executive, and Low-Memory/Language groups compared to the All-Average group suggests that there are multiple pathways and/or unique subtle cognitive decline profiles that ultimately lead to a diagnosis of MCI/dementia. Use of comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries that assess several domains may be a key first step toward an individualized approach to early detection and fewer missed opportunities for early intervention.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The ATN scheme was proposed as an unbiased biological characterization of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum, grouping biomarkers into three categories: brain Amyloidosis-A, Tauopathy-T, Neurodegeneration-N. Although this scheme was mainly recommended for research, it is relevant for diagnosis.To evaluate the ATN scheme performance in real-life cohorts reflecting the inflow of patients with cognitive complaints and different underlying disorders in general neurological centers.We included patients (n\u200a=\u200a1,128) from six centers with their core cerebrospinal fluid-AD biomarkers analyzed centrally. A was assessed through A\u03b242/A\u03b240, T through pTau-181, and N through tTau. Association between demographic features, clinical diagnosis at baseline/follow-up and ATN profiles was assessed.The prevalence of ATN categories was: A-T-N-: 28.3%; AD continuum (A\u200a+\u200aT-/+N-/+): 47.8%; non-AD (A- plus T or/and N+): 23.9%. ATN profiles prevalence was strongly influenced by age, showing differences according to gender, APOE genotype, and cognitive status. At baseline, 74.6% of patients classified as AD fell in the AD continuum, decreasing to 47.4% in mild cognitive impairment and 42.3% in other neurodegenerative conditions. At follow-up, 41% of patients changed diagnosis, and 92% of patients that changed to AD were classified within the AD continuum. A\u200a+\u200awas the best individual marker for predicting a final AD diagnosis, and the combinations A\u200a+\u200aT+ (irrespective of N) and A\u200a+\u200aT+N+ had the highest overall accuracy (83%).The ATN scheme is useful to guide AD diagnosis in real-life neurological centers settings. However, it shows a lack of accuracy for patients with other types of dementia. In such cases, the inclusion of other markers specific for non-AD proteinopathies could be an important aid to the differential diagnosis.",

Subclinical epileptiform discharge (SED) has no evident clinical manifestation in patients with AD. Therefore, SED is liable to be overlooked in these patients since electroencephalography is not routinely performed in clinical settings. Previous studies about the association between SED and AD have yielded inconsistent results.The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of SED and its effect on AD severity and clinical outcomes.Patients with AD from Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-tung Hospital were included in this study. International 10-20 system scalp electroencephalography for 13 minutes was performed to detect SED. Clinical outcomes of patients with and without SED were assessed by neuropsychological tests [Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB)].288 patients (mean age 80.5 years, 60.4% female) were enrolled in this study. Fifty-seven (19.8%) out of 288 patients with AD had SED. The prevalence of SED increased with the severity of cognitive impairment. Compared with patients without SED, those with SED showed significantly greater decline in CASI (-9.32 versus -3.52 points, p\u200a=\u200a0.0001) and MMSE (-2.52 versus -1.12 points, p\u200a=\u200a0.0042) scores in one year.SED may play a significant role in AD progression and is a potential therapeutic target.",

We computed diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index as the proxy of glymphatic system activity, and estimated the relationships between the DTI-ALPS index and A\u03b2 and tau protein/inflammatory deposition.We found significant negative correlations between DTI-ALPS index and the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 11C-PiB in the bilateral temporal and left parietal cortices and left posterior cingulate gyrus in all subjects. Further, we detected significant negative correlations between DTI-ALPS index and the SUVR of 18F-THK5351 in the bilateral temporal cortices and right parietal cortex in all participants, too.Our data suggested that DTI-ALPS index was a good biomarker for the evaluation of A\u03b2 and tau deposition and neuroinflammation, and this marker might be effective to estimate the glymphatic system activity.",

Adjusted geometric mean ratio (% [90% CI]) for maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (0-168\u200ah) were 88.7 (81.7-96.2) and 108.6 (100.5-117.4) for 10-mg/d and 86.1 (79.8-92.9) and 105.3 (97.6-113.6) for dose-normalized 5-mg/d TDS and were generally within the 80% -125% range for establishing bioequivalence with oral donepezil. Skin adhesion was similar for both TDSs (>80% of patches remaining \u226575% adhered throughout the wear period). Overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar across treatments. Compared with 10-mg/d TDS, oral donepezil was associated with higher incidence of gastrointestinal and nervous system AEs (14.5% versus 53.6% and 14.5% versus 30.4%, respectively).Donepezil TDSs are bioequivalent to oral donepezil at steady state and have a safety profile that supports their use in treating dementia of the Alzheimer type.",

People with dementia living alone are particularly at risk. Considering the growing number of technologies proposed to aid people with dementia address social isolation and loneliness, we reviewed the existing literature.To collate and summarize current evidence for digital technologies to prevent social isolation and loneliness for people with dementia.Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched five databases to identify studies of digital technologies designed to support or prevent social isolation or loneliness for people with dementia. Pre-specified outcomes included social isolation, loneliness, and quality of life. We used deductive thematic analysis to synthesize the major themes emerging from the studies.Ten studies met our inclusion criteria where all studies reported improvements in quality of life and seven reported benefits regarding social inclusion or a reduction in loneliness. Technologies were varied across purpose, delivery format, theoretical models, and levels of personalization. Two studies clearly described the involvement of people with dementia in the study design and five technologies were available outside the research context.There is limited- but increasing- evidence that technologies hold potential to improve quality of life and reduce isolation/loneliness for people with dementia. Results presented are largely based in small-scale research studies. Involvement of people with dementia was limited and few research concepts are reaching implementation. Closer collaboration with people with dementia to provide affordable, inclusive, and person-centered solutions is urgently required.",

One hundred and twenty patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly assigned to receive 40\u200amg of simvastatin per day or matching placebo for 12 weeks (sixty patients per group). Plasma A\u03b2, sLRP1, sRAGE, and lipid levels were measured at baseline and at the 6-week and 12-week visits.The ITT database ultimately included 108 participants (placebo group: n\u200a=\u200a53; simvastatin group: n\u200a=\u200a55) and 64 (59.3%) were women, ranging in age from 45 to 75 years (mean 57.2\u00b16.9 years). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that, after 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with the placebo group, \u0394A\u03b242 levels (the change of A\u03b242 levels from baseline at week 12) increased more and \u0394sRAGE levels decreased more in the simvastatin group (A\u03b242: \u03b2=\u200a5.823, p\u200a=\u200a0.040; sRAGE: \u03b2=\u200a-72.012, p\u200a=\u200a0.031), and a significant negative association was found between \u0394A\u03b242 and \u0394sRAGE levels (\u03b2=\u200a-0.115, p\u200a=\u200a0.045).

Patients with a broader clinical presentation, i.e., combining manifestations of one PPA subtype and symptoms of another PPA variant, had autopsy comorbidities showing multiple neurodegenerative disorders.

In eight brain samples, different comorbid neuropathologies were detected: three cases with comorbid AD and dementia with Lewy bodies, two cases with comorbid AD and TDP-43 pathology, one case with comorbid AD and complex tauopathies, and one case with comorbid AD with both tau and TDP-43 deposits. Finally, one case had comorbid tau and TDP-43 pathology but without comorbid AD pathology.Our observation suggests that PPA cases could be more heterogeneous in their etiology than previously thought and underlying neurodegenerative comorbidities should be considered in routine practice, especially if the clinical presentation of PPA is atypical.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Many low- and middle-income countries, including Latin America, lack access to biomarkers for the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (AD; mild cognitive impairment due to AD) and AD dementia. MRI visual rating scales may serve as an ancillary diagnostic tool for identifying prodromal AD or AD in Latin America. We investigated the ability of brain MRI visual rating scales to distinguish between cognitively healthy controls, prodromal AD and AD.A cross-sectional study was conducted from a multidisciplinary neurology clinic in Lima, Peru using neuropsychological assessments, brain MRI and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and tau levels. Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), posterior atrophy (PA), white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and MTA+PA composite MRI scores were compared. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were determined.Fifty-three patients with prodromal AD, 69 with AD, and 63 cognitively healthy elderly individuals were enrolled. The median age was 75 (8) and 42.7% were men. Neither sex, mean age, nor years of education were significantly different between groups. The MTA was higher in patients with AD (p < 0.0001) compared with prodromal AD and controls, and MTA scores adjusted by age range (p < 0.0001) and PA scores (p < 0.0001) were each significantly associated with AD diagnosis (p < 0.0001) but not the WMH score (p=0.426). The MTA had better performance among ages <75 years (AUC 0.90 [0.85-0.95]), while adjusted MTA+PA scores performed better among ages>75 years (AUC 0.85 [0.79-0.92]). For AD diagnosis, MTA+PA had the best performance (AUC 1.00) for all age groups.Combining MTA and PA scores demonstrates greater discriminative ability to differentiate controls from prodromal AD and AD, highlighting the diagnostic value of visual rating scales in daily clinical practice, particularly in Latin America where access to advanced neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers is limited in the clinical setting.",

In fact, these functions are far from separate and it is believed that interactions between the striatum and hippocampus are important for memory processing. The data relating to vestibular-hippocampal-striatal interactions have considerable implications for the understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease, in addition to other neurological disorders. However, evidence is accumulating rapidly, and it is difficult to keep up with the latest developments in these and related areas.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Sexual minority (SM) older adults experience mental health disparities. Psychiatric disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are risk factors for cognitive decline. Although older people in same-sex (SSR) compared to mixed-sex relationships (MSR) perform more poorly on cognitive screening tests, prior studies found no differences in rates of dementia diagnosis or neuropsychological profiles. We sought to explore the role of NPS on neurocognitive outcomes for SM populations. We compared cognitive performance and structural brain parameters of older adults in SSR and MSR.Data were originally collected at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs). Inclusion criteria were: age of 55+ years, a study partner identified as a spouse/partner, and availability of T1-MRI brain volumes/thickness. Participants were labeled as either SSR or MSR based on their/their co-participant's reported sex. We identified 1,073 participants (1,037 MSR-555 cognitively unimpaired [CU]; 36 SSR-23 CU) with structural MRI data, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores. A subset of the overall sample completed comprehensive neuropsychological assessment (n = 939; 908 MSR-494 CU; 31 SSR-22 CU). Covariates included in statistical models were age, sex, education, total intracranial volume, and apolipoprotein E genotype.Multivariate general linear models showed significant diagnosis-by-relationship interaction effects on the left parahippocampal gyrus volume. After stratification by relationship group, only cognitively impaired (CI) MSR had significantly smaller left parahippocampal volumes than MSR-CU. The SSR group showed better episodic memory performance. Severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms was negatively associated with volume/thickness of bilateral fronto-temporal areas and with MMSE scores, predominantly in the MSR group.In our study, MSR participants presented with a more compromised cognitive profile than SSR participants. MSR-CI participants showed significantly smaller left medio-temporal volumes, a neural signature of AD. Neuropsychiatric symptoms predicted smaller fronto-temporal volumes in the MSR more consistently than in the SSR group. These findings may be due to unexplored protective factors against cognitive decline in SM elders. Indeed, social support has been proposed as a protective factor warranting future investigation.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most commonly seen neurodegenerative brain disorder. The paracrine effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) signify to trigger immunomodulation and neural regeneration. However, the role and mechanism of bone marrow MSC- (BMSC-) derived CX3CL1 in AD remains elusive. In this study, A\u03b2 1-42-intervened SH-SY5Y cells were used for AD cell model construction. pcDNA-ligated CX3CL1 overexpression plasmids were transfected into BMSCs. The levels of soluble and membrane-bound CX3CL1 were detected by ELISA and Western blotting (WB), respectively. The growth, apoptosis, and pathology of AD model cells were evaluated by CCK-8, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, morphology observation, biochemical examination, and WB. It was found that A\u03b2 1-42 significantly reduced CX3CL1 expression either in soluble or membrane-bound form, cell viability, relative protein expression of synaptic markers, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px contents, as well as Trx protein expression; in addition, it enhanced the apoptosis rate, the relative expression of cleaved caspase-3, A\u03b2, tau, p-Tau, Iba1, MDA, TXNIP, and NLRP3 in SH-SY5Y cells; however, the above effects were prominently reversed by the coculture of BMSCs. Moreover, overexpression of CX3CL1 in BMSCs observably strengthened the corresponding tendency caused by BMSCs. In conclusion, through the TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway, CX3CL1 derived from BMSCs inhibited pathological damage in A\u03b2 1-42-induced SH-SY5Y.",

A total of 168 patients admitted to our hospital from November 2019 to December 2021 were enrolled. Patients were divided into the NC (no SP and AD) group with 29 cases, the AD group with 39 cases, the AD+SP group with 35 cases, and the SP group with 65 cases. The general information, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and serum levels of AGEs and Hcy among the four groups were compared. Unordered logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of SP patients complicated with dementia. The AGE level was higher in the AD or AD+SP group than the NC or SP group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the SP group and the NC group or between the AD group and the AD+SP group (P > 0.05). The Hcy level was higher in the SP or AD group than the NC group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the AD group and NC group or between the SP group and AD+SP group (P > 0.05). The ROC curve of serum AGEs and Hcy for the diagnosis of AD showed that the area under curve (AUC) was 0.887, P < 0.05 (95% CI: 0.821-0.954, sensitivity: 80.95%, specificity: 73.81%) and 0.7423, P < 0.05 (95% CI: 0.6382-0.8465, sensitivity: 60.42%, specificity: 57.59%), respectively.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Harnessing the lifelong potential of the human brain for neuroplasticity may serve to maintain the viability of neural structures and postpone the onset of cognitive decline. The absence of effective pharmacological interventions to counter memory decline has encouraged scientists to test the possibility that noninvasive electrical stimulation may serve as an additional tool to improve memory abilities.Previous research showed that electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve enhances memory recall performance in young and older healthy subjects. This study aims to extend these findings to determine the effect of transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve on the improvement of episodic memory in individuals with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI).This study is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel-group study. A total of 100 individuals with a diagnosis of aMCI according to NIA/AA will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. One group will receive active non-invasive transcutaneous electrical stimulation of greater occipital nerve (NITESGON), while three groups will serve as controls (i.e., sham NITESGON, active NITESGON with local anesthesia, and active NITESGON on the C5/C6 nerve). The primary outcome, i.e., memory recall, will be determined by a word association task, and will be recorded at baseline, 7 days after NITESGON, and 28 days after NITESGON. The secondary outcome is neurophysiological changes determined by resting state EEG and will be assessed immediately before and after NITESGON.The results will add new insights into improving episodic memory in individuals with aMCI.#NCT05289804 (clinicaltrial.gov).#SPREC102021-23 (Ethics Committee at Trinity College Dublin, School of Psychology).",

Following the recent Aducanumab trials, we sought to study the implications of dose changes on the statistical power of an AD trial. We conducted extensive simulations to calculate statistical power when the relationship between treatment effect size and time is linear or non-linear, and the investigated drug has delayed treatment effect or not. Statistical power depends on many design factors including the dose change time, correlation, population homogeneity, and treatment effect time.

The APOE \u03b54 allele was more common in AD patients (23.2%) than in controls (7.4%; p < 0.01) and the PSEN2 p.Arg29His and p.Cys391Arg variants were found in 3 AD and 1 MCI patient, respectively. Also, we found the frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-associated TARDBP gene p.Ile383Val variant in 2 elderly patients diagnosed with AD and in 2 patients, non CAC members, with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/FTD phenotype. Furthermore, the p.Ser498Ala variant in the positively selected GLUD2 gene was less frequent in AD patients (2.11%) than in controls (16%; p < 0.01), suggesting a possible protective effect. While the same trend was found in another local replication cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0406) and in section of the ADNI cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0808), this finding did not reach statistical significance and therefore it should be considered preliminary.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Using synaptosomes purified from the brains of two transgenic mouse models overexpressing mutated human tau (TgP301S and Tg4510) and brains of patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, we showed that aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau was both present in purified synaptosomes and released in a calcium- and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25)-dependent manner. In all mouse and human synaptosomal preparations, tau release was inhibited by the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonist LY379268, an effect prevented by the selective mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495. LY379268 was also able to block pathologic tau propagation between primary neurons in an in vitro microfluidic cellular model. These novel results are transformational for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating tau release and propagation at synaptic terminals in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that these processes could be inhibited therapeutically by the selective activation of presynaptic G protein-coupled receptors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pathological tau release and propagation are key neuropathological events underlying cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients. This paper describes the role of regulated exocytosis, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) protein SNAP25, in mediating tau release from rodent and human synaptosomes. This paper also shows that a selective mGluR2/3 agonist is highly effective in blocking tau release from synaptosomes and tau propagation between neurons, opening the way to the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches to this devastating disease.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The widely studied triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse provides a robust model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with region dependent patterns of progressive amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u00df) and tau pathology. Using diffusion MRI (dMRI), we investigated the sensitivity of dMRI measures in capturing AD pathology associated microstructure alterations in older 3xTg-AD mice, and the degree to which dMRI changes correlate with measurements of A\u03b2 and tau pathology. 3xTg-AD and normal control (NC) mice, 15 to 21\u00a0months of age, were used in this study. In vivo dMRI data were acquired for the generation of diffusion tensor (DT) and diffusional kurtosis (DK) measures within the hippocampus and fimbria (Fi). For these same brain regions, A\u03b2 and tau pathology were quantified by morphological analysis of A\u00df1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity. Two-tailed, two-sample t-tests were performed to assess group differences in each brain region of interest (ROI), with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method being applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate associations between diffusion and morphological measures. Our results revealed, depending on the brain region, DT and DK measures were able to detect group differences. In the dorsal hippocampus (HD), fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly higher in the 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. In the subiculum (SUB), FA, axial diffusivity (D||) and radial kurtosis (K\u2534) were significantly higher in 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. Morphological quantification of A\u00df1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity showed elevated A\u00df and tau in the Fi, ventral hippocampus (HV) and SUB of 3xTg-AD mice. The presence of A\u03b2 and tau was significantly correlated with several DT and DK measures, particularly in the SUB, where an increase in tau correlated with an increase in mean kurtosis (MK) and K\u2534. This work demonstrates significant dMRI differences between older 3xTg-AD and NC mice in the hippocampus and Fi. Significant correlations were found between dMRI and morphological measures of A\u03b2 and tau pathology. These results support the potential of dMRI-derived parameters as biomarkers of AD pathology. Since the imaging methods employed here are easily translatable to clinical MRI, our results are also relevant for human AD patients.",

It is unclear whether the same relationship is present in regions with lower ambient air pollution.To determine whether exposure to air pollution is associated with risk of incident dementia in general, and Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in particular, in older men living in a relatively low ambient air pollution region.The cohort comprised 11,243 men residing in Perth, Australia. Participants were aged \u226565 years and free of a dementia diagnosis at time of recruitment in 1996-1999. Incident dementia was identified from recruitment to 2018 via ICD diagnosis codes and subsequent study waves. Concentrations for three air pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5), and black carbon (BC) were estimated at participants' home addresses using land-use regression models. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for smoking status, physical activity, BMI, education, and socio-economic status.Of 3053 (27.2%) incident cases of dementia, 1670 (54.7%) and 355 (11.6%) had documented Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The average concentration of NO2 was 13.5 (SD 4.4) \u03bcg/m3, of PM2.5 was 4.54 (SD 1.6) \u03bcg/m3 and of BC was 0.97 (SD 0.29) \u00d710-5\u00a0m-1. None of the air pollutants were associated with incident dementia or Alzheimer's disease. In the unadjusted model, increased exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia (for a 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 increase: HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13, 2.31). However, this association was attenuated following adjustment for confounders (HR 1.39, 95% CI 0.93, 2.08). NO2 and BC were not associated with vascular dementia incidence.Exposure to air pollution is not associated with increased risk of incident dementia in older men living in a region with relatively low ambient air pollution.",

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) at baseline were related to cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and attention and executive functioning score (A&E)) in linear regression analyses, adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and treatment, at baseline and follow-up.CKD at baseline was more common in CARMELINA than CAROLINA (eGFR<60 in 72.6\u00a0% and 19.6\u00a0%, macroalbuminuria in 35.0\u00a0% and 4.1\u00a0%, respectively). Baseline eGFR was related to A&E in CARMELINA (b\u00a0=\u00a00.02 per 10\u00a0ml/min/1.73m2, 95%CI [0.01,0.03]). Baseline UACR was related to A&E in CAROLINA (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.01 per doubling of UACR mg/g, 95%CI [-0.02,-0.002]). Baseline UACR predicted decline in A&E in CAROLINA (median 6.1\u00a0years follow-up; b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.01, 95%CI [-0.03,-0.0001] per doubling of UACR mg/g).eGFR and UACR were associated with A&E in two cohorts with type 2 diabetes, enriched for CKD and cardiovascular disease.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Mentalizing and emotion recognition are impaired in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). It is not clear whether these abilities are also disturbed in other conditions with prominent frontal lobe involvement, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Our aim was to investigate social cognition (facial emotion recognition, recognition of social norms violation and mentalizing) in bvFTD and PSP. The neural basis of these functions in PSP and bvFTD groups, by analysis of structural neuroimaging, were also investigated. Twenty-three bvFTD patients, 21 PSP patients and 23 healthy controls were included. All participants underwent 3T brain MRI and a full cognitive exam including the short version of Social and Emotional Assessment (Mini-SEA), which is composed of a facial emotion recognition test (FERT) and the faux pas test. Two components of the faux pas test were distinguished: a score assessing the recognition of social norms violation and a score assessing mentalizing. Compared to controls, bvFTD and PSP patients had significantly reduced scores in all tests of social cognition but did not differ on these measures. PSP and bvFTD had cerebral atrophy in critical regions for social cognition processes, when compared to controls. The cortical correlates of emotion recognition partially overlapped in bvFTD and PSP, with correlations retrieved within the frontal medial cortex, cingulate, insula and limbic structures. PSP and bvFTD patients also displayed similar patterns of brain correlations for the composite score of social norms, with a significant cluster in anterior temporal lobes. Mentalizing scores were associated with frontal and temporal poles bilaterally, in both bvFTD and PSP. These findings support previous observations that PSP patients exhibit impairment in complex cognitive abilities, such as mentalizing. Moreover, these data extend previous findings showing that PSP and bvFTD share key clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging features.",

Endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway (eNOS) upregulation is known to support endothelial health. This single-center, proof-of-concept study tested whether the use of three medications known to augment the eNOS pathway activity improves cognition and cerebral blood flow (CBF).Subjects with mild AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were sequentially treated with the HMG-CoA reductase synthesis inhibitor simvastatin (weeks 0-16), L-arginine (weeks 4-16), and tetrahydrobiopterin (weeks 8-16). The primary outcome of interest was the change in CBF as measured by MRI from baseline to week 16. Secondary outcomes included standard assessments of cognition.A total of 11 subjects were deemed eligible and enrolled. One subject withdrew from the study after enrollment, leaving 10 subjects for data analysis. There was a significant increase in CBF from baseline to week 8 by ~13% in the limbic and ~15% in the cerebral cortex. Secondary outcomes indicated a modest but significant increase in the MMSE from baseline (24.2\u00b13.2) to week 16 (26.0\u00b12.7). Exploratory analysis indicated that subjects with cognitive improvement (reduction of the ADAS-cog 13) had a significant increase in their respective limbic and cortical CBF.Treatment of mild AD/MCI subjects with medications shown to augment the eNOS pathway was well tolerated and associated with modestly increased cerebral blood flow and cognitive improvement.This study is registered in https://www.gov ; registration identifier: NCT01439555; date of registration submitted to registry: 09/23/2011; date of first subject enrollment: 11/2011.",

Significantly higher levels of AQP4 were found in AD and FTD patients compared to subjects not affected by neurodegenerative diseases, and a significant, positive correlation between AQP4 and total tau levels was found.

Neuronal plasma membranes serve as biologically relevant environments for the A\u03b2 aggregation process as well as affect the structural polymorphisms of A\u03b2 aggregates. However, the nature of these interactions is unknown. Here, we utilized solid-state NMR spectroscopy to explore the site-specific interactions between A\u03b2 peptides and lipids in synaptic plasma membranes at the membrane-associated nucleation stage. The key results show that different segments in the hydrophobic sequence of A\u03b2 initiate membrane binding and interstrand assembling. We demonstrate early stage A\u03b2-lipid interactions modulate lipid dynamics, leading to more rapid lipid headgroup motion and reduced lateral diffusive motion. These early events influence the structural polymorphisms of yielded membrane-associated A\u03b2 fibrils with distinct C-terminal quaternary interface structure compared to fibrils grown in aqueous solutions. Based on our results, we propose a schematic mechanism by which A\u03b2-lipid interactions drive membrane-associated nucleation processes, providing molecular insights into the early events of fibrillation in biological environments.",

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) refers to a heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes with different underlying proteinopathies including tau pathology. CSF biomarkers have been proposed as diagnostic and prognostic factors. Aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between CSF tau biomarkers and structural MRI brain measures in FTLD.We included early FTLD patient. All included patients underwent lumbar puncture to evaluate amyloid, total-tau (t-tau), phospho-tau 181 (p-tau); p-tau/t-tau ratio was also calculated; brain MRI was performed to estimate whole brain volume, volume of principal deep grey matter structures and regional cortical thickness.Demographic characteristics of the 28 included patients were as follows: female/male: 9/19; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD age: 68.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8\u00a0years. The p-tau/t-tau ratio was significantly correlated with whole brain volume (r\u00a0=\u00a00.69; p: 0.001), left putamen volume (r\u00a0=\u00a00.55 p: 0.009), left pallidum volume (r\u00a0=\u00a00.41; p: 0.01), right accumbens area (r\u00a0=\u00a00.47; p: 0.02). P-tau/t tau ratio showed also a significant correlation with cortical thickness of left temporal lobe (r\u00a0=\u00a00.74; p: 0.001) and right lateral orbital frontal cortex (r\u00a0=\u00a00.45; p: 0.03). Linear regression showed a significant relationship between p-tau/t-tau ratio and left temporal pole (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01; r2: 0.60) and brain volume (p:0.002; r2: 0.56) after controlling for age and gender.Our data suggest that CSF biomarkers, especially p-tau/t-tau ratio, could play a role as prognostic factor in FTLD. Further longitudinal investigations are needed to confirm these findings.",

We related self-reported liver disease to longitudinal measures of brain structure and cognition, as well as baseline measures of plasma AD/neurodegeneration biomarkers in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Liver disease was identified using ICD-9 classification codes. Brain volume and cognition were assessed serially using 3T-MRI and a cognitive battery. 1008, 2157, and 780 participants were included in the MRI, cognitive, and plasma biomarker analysis, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, liver disease was associated with accelerated decline in total brain and white matter volume, but not total gray matter or AD signature region volume. Although liver disease showed no relationship with domain-specific cognitive decline or plasma biomarkers, participants with a history of hepatitis demonstrated accelerated decline in verbal fluency and elevated neurofilament light.

        "ArticleTitle": "Self-supervised learning of neighborhood embedding for longitudinal MRI.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "In recent years, several deep learning models recommend first to represent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as latent features before performing a downstream task of interest (such as classification or regression). The performance of the downstream task generally improves when these latent representations are explicitly associated with factors of interest. For example, we derived such a representation for capturing brain aging by applying self-supervised learning to longitudinal MRIs and then used the resulting encoding to automatically identify diseases accelerating the aging of the brain. We now propose a refinement of this representation by replacing the linear modeling of brain aging with one that is consistent in local neighborhoods in the latent space. Called Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE), we derive an encoding so that neighborhoods are age-consistent (i.e., brain MRIs of different subjects with similar brain ages are in close proximity of each other) and progression-consistent, i.e., the latent space is defined by a smooth trajectory field where each trajectory captures changes in brain ages between a pair of MRIs extracted from a longitudinal sequence. To make the problem computationally tractable, we further propose a strategy for mini-batch sampling so that the resulting local neighborhoods accurately approximate the ones that would be defined based on the whole cohort. We evaluate LNE on three different downstream tasks: (1) to predict chronological age from T1-w MRI of 274 healthy subjects participating in a study at SRI International; (2) to distinguish Normal Control (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (sMCI) from progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (pMCI) based on T1-w MRI of 632 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); and (3) to distinguish no-to-low from moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinkers based on fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor MRIs of 764 adolescents recruited by the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Across the three data sets, the visualization of the smooth trajectory vector fields and superior accuracy on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information related to brain aging, which could help study the impact of substance use and neurodegenerative disorders.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRMs) are ubiquitous when analyzing outcomes of clinical trials. However, the linearity of the fixed-effect structure in these models largely restrict their use to estimating treatment effects that are defined as linear combinations of effects on the outcome scale. In some situations, alternative quantifications of treatment effects may be more appropriate. In progressive diseases, for example, one may want to estimate if a drug has cumulative effects resulting in increasing efficacy over time or whether it slows the time progression of disease. This article introduces a class of nonlinear mixed-effects models called progression models for repeated measures (PMRMs) that, based on a continuous-time extension of the categorical-time parametrization of MMRMs, enables estimation of novel types of treatment effects, including measures of slowing or delay of the time progression of disease. Compared to conventional estimates of treatment effects where the unit matches that of the outcome scale (eg, 2 points benefit on a cognitive scale), the time-based treatment effects can offer better interpretability and clinical meaningfulness (eg, 6\u00a0months delay in progression of cognitive decline). The PMRM class includes conventionally used MMRMs and related models for longitudinal data analysis, as well as variants of previously proposed disease progression models as special cases. The potential of the PMRM framework is illustrated using both simulated and historical data from clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease with different types of artificially simulated treatment effects. Compared to conventional models it is shown that PMRMs can offer substantially increased power to detect disease-modifying treatment effects where the benefit is increasing with treatment duration.",

Tau lesion starts in the trans-entorhinal cortex, from where it spreads to limbic regions, followed by neocortical areas. The regional distribution of NFTs associates with the progression of AD. Accumulating evidence suggests that proteopathic tau can seed tau aggregation in a prion-like fashion in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of tau seeding activity could provide a potential therapeutic opportunity to block the propagation of tau pathology in AD and related tauopathies.In the present study, we investigated the role of 77G7, a monoclonal tau antibody to the microtubule-binding repeats, in repressing the seeding activity of proteopathic tau.We found that 77G7 had a higher affinity toward aggregated pathological tau fractions than un-aggregated tau derived from AD brain. 77G7 inhibited the internalization of tau aggregates by cells, blocked AD O-tau to capture normal tau, and to seed tau aggregation in vitro and in cultured cells. Tau pathology induced by hippocampal injection of AD O-tau in 3xTg-AD mice was suppressed by mixing 77G7 with AD O-tau. Intravenous administration of 77G7 ameliorated site-specific hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by AD O-tau in the hippocampi of Tg/hTau mice.These findings indicate that 77G7 can effectively suppress the seeding activity of AD O-tau and thus could be developed as a potential immunotherapeutic drug to inhibit the propagation of tau pathology in AD and related tauopathies.",

The MSRA-5 displayed a sensitivity of 3.2%, a specificity of 89.9% and an AUC of 0.41 using EWGSOP1, whereas sensitivity was of 0%, specificity of 91.1% and the AUC of 0.55 using EWGSOP2 criteria. The questionnaires showed a moderate agreement (Cohen's k\u2009=\u20090.53).In our sample of AD patients, a sizable number of sarcopenic individuals were misidentified by SARC-F-3 and MSRA-5, making those questionnaires unsuitable for sarcopenia screening. Considering that sarcopenia has a high prevalence in dementia and that its correct and timely identification is paramount for optimal management of patients, the development and validation of an ad-hoc sarcopenia screening tool for AD patients is highly desirable.",

Early identification of underlying neurodegenerative processes is essential to provide treatment before the disease is well established in the brain. Here we used longitudinal data from the ADNI database to investigate prediction of a trajectory towards AD in a group of patients defined as MCI at a baseline examination. One group remained stable over time (sMCI, n = 357) and one converted to AD (cAD, n = 321). By running two independent classification methods within a machine learning framework, with cognitive function, hippocampal volume and genetic APOE status as features, we obtained a cross-validation classification accuracy of about 70%. This level of accuracy was confirmed across different classification methods and validation procedures. Moreover, the sets of misclassified subjects had a large overlap between the two models. Impaired memory function was consistently found to be one of the core symptoms of MCI patients on a trajectory towards AD. The prediction above chance level shown in the present study should inspire further work to develop tools that can aid clinicians in making prognostic decisions.",

Alzheimer Disease (AD) requires new biomarkers in minimally invasive samples that allow an early diagnosis. The aim of this work is to study miRNAS as potential AD biomarkers and their role in the pathology development. In this study, participants (n\u2009=\u200946) were classified into mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD, n\u2009=\u200919), preclinical AD (n\u2009=\u20098) and healthy elderly controls (n\u2009=\u200919), according to CSF biomarkers levels (amyloid \u03b242, total tau, phosphorylated tau) and neuropsychological assessment. Then, plasma miRNAomic expression profiles were analysed by Next Generation Sequencing. Finally, the selected miRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR (q-PCR). A panel of 11 miRNAs was selected from omics expression analysis, and 8 of them were validated by q-PCR. Individually, they did not show statistically significant differences among participant groups. However, a multivariate model including these 8 miRNAs revealed a potential association with AD for three of them. Specifically, relatively lower expression levels of miR-92a-3p and miR-486-5p are observed in AD patients, and relatively higher levels of miR-29a-3p are observed in AD patients. These biomarkers could be involved in the regulation of pathways such as synaptic transmission, structural functions, cell signalling and metabolism or transcription regulation. Some plasma miRNAs (miRNA-92a-3p, miRNA-486-5p, miRNA-29a-3p) are slightly dysregulated in AD, being potential biomarkers of the pathology. However, more studies with a large sample size should be carried out to verify these results, as well as to further investigate the mechanisms of action of these miRNAs.",

Thus disaggregation of tau fibrils could be a therapeutic approach to AD. The small molecule EGCG, abundant in green tea, has long been known to disaggregate tau and other amyloid fibrils, but EGCG has poor drug-like properties, failing to fully penetrate the brain. Here we have cryogenically trapped an intermediate of brain-extracted tau fibrils on the kinetic pathway to EGCG-induced disaggregation and have determined its cryoEM structure. The structure reveals that EGCG molecules stack in polar clefts between the paired helical protofilaments that pathologically define AD. Treating the EGCG binding position as a pharmacophore, we computationally screened thousands of drug-like compounds for compatibility for the pharmacophore, discovering several that experimentally disaggregate brain-derived tau fibrils in vitro. This work suggests the potential of structure-based, small-molecule drug discovery for amyloid diseases.",

This comorbidity might be due to a pleiotropic effect of genetic variants shared between CD and AD/D. Here, we validated comorbidity of CD and AD/D based on diagnostic records from millions of patients in Korea and the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center (odds ratio 11.5 [8.5-15.5, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)]). By integrating a comprehensive human disease-SNP association database (VARIMED, VARiants Informing MEDicine) and whole-exome sequencing of 50 brains from individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), we identified missense variants in coding regions including APOB, a known risk factor for CD and AD/D, which potentially have a pleiotropic role in both diseases. Of the identified variants, site-directed mutation of ADIPOQ (268\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A; Gly90Ser) in neurons produced abnormal aggregation of tau proteins (p\u2009=\u20090.02), suggesting a functional impact for AD/D. The association of CD and ADIPOQ variants was confirmed based on domain deletion in cardiac cells. Using the UK Biobank including data from over 500000 individuals, we examined a pleiotropic effect of the ADIPOQ variant by comparing CD- and AD/D-associated phenotypic evidence, including cardiac hypertrophy and cognitive degeneration. These results indicate that convergence of health care records and genetic evidences may help to dissect the molecular underpinnings of heart disease and associated cognitive impairment, and could potentially serve a prognostic function. Validation of disease-disease associations through health care records and genomic evidence can determine whether health conditions share risk factors based on pleiotropy.",

Episodic memory retrieval has been widely studied during ageing, whereas learning has received less attention. Here we examined the neural correlates of episodic learning rate in ageing. Our study sample consisted of 982 cognitively healthy female and male older participants from the Vallecas Project cohort, without a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The learning rate across the three consecutive recall trials of the verbal memory task (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) recall trials was used as a predictor of grey matter (GM) using voxel-based morphometry, and WM microstructure using tract-based spatial statistics on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measures. Immediate Recall improved by 1.4 items per trial on average, and this episodic learning rate was faster in women and negatively associated with age. Structurally, hippocampal and anterior thalamic GM volume correlated positively with learning rate. Learning also correlated with the integrity of WM microstructure (high FA and low MD) in an extensive network of tracts including bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, fornix, and long-range tracts. These results suggest that episodic learning rate is associated with key anatomical structures for memory functioning, motivating further exploration of the differential diagnostic properties between episodic learning rate and retrieval in ageing.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) has been a common public health problem, which is associated with central nervous system dysfunction according to large-scale epidemiological studies. Current studies are mostly limited to artificial laboratory exposure environments and specific genetic mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, we chose a real-world transportation environment to expose aged mice, transporting them from the laboratory to a 1-m-high dry platform inside the campus and tunnel, and the mice were exposed daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. for 2, 4 and 12 weeks respectively. Compared with the control group (in campus), the memory function of mice in the experimental group (in tunnel) was significantly impaired in the Morris water maze test. TRAP exposure increased the number of activated microglia in the hippocampal DG, CA1, CA3 regions and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC). And neuroinflammation and oxidative stress levels were up-regulated in both hippocampus and dPFC of aged mice. By screening the risk genes of Alzheimer's disease, we found the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA7 were down-regulated and those of PYK2 were up-regulated. The DNA methylation ratios increased in four CpG sites of abca7 promoter region and decreased in one CpG site of pyk2 promoter region, which were consistent with the altered expression of ABCA7 and PYK2. In conclusion, exposure to the real traffic environment impaired memory function and enhanced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress responses, which could be relevant to the altered expression and DNA methylation levels of ABCA7 and PYK2. Our work provides a new and promising understanding of the pathological mechanisms of cognitive impairment caused by traffic-related air pollution.",

Despite early mentions of dementia in the ancient literature and the first patient diagnosed in 1906, the underlying causes of AD are not well understood. This study examined the possible role of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is involved in cognitive and motor function, in AD. We treated adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) with okadaic acid (OKA) to model AD and assessed the resulting behavioral and neurochemical changes. We then employed a latent learning paradigm to assess cognitive and motor function followed by neurochemical analysis with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon fiber microelectrodes to measure the electrically stimulated dopamine release. The behavioral assay showed that OKA treatment caused fish to have lower motivation to reach the goal chamber, resulting in impeded learning and decreased locomotor activity compared to controls. Our voltammetric measurements revealed that the peak dopamine overflow in OKA-treated fish was about one-third of that measured in controls. These findings highlight the profound neurochemical changes that may occur in AD. Furthermore, they demonstrate that applying the latent learning paradigm and FSCV to zebrafish is a promising tool for future neurochemical studies and may be useful for screening drugs for the treatment of AD.",

Biomedical tests revealed two mechanisms were involved. Firstly, acetoacetate inhibited the GPR43-pERK pathway, which led to apparent inhibition in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and Interleukin-6 expression in the hippocampus in a concentration-dependent manner.

Recently, we reported benzyl piperidinyl-linked methoxy-naphthamides as dual ChE inhibitors.

A range of traditional interventions has been developed to support family caregivers; however, most of them have not been implemented in practice and remain largely inaccessible. While recent studies have shown that family caregivers of people with dementia use Twitter to discuss their experiences, methods have not been developed to enable the use of Twitter for interventions.The objective of this study is to develop an annotated data set and benchmark classification models for automatically identifying a cohort of Twitter users who have a family member with dementia.Between May 4 and May 20, 2021, we collected 10,733 tweets, posted by 8846 users, that mention a dementia-related keyword, a linguistic marker that potentially indicates a diagnosis, and a select familial relationship. Three annotators annotated 1 random tweet per user to distinguish those that indicate having a family member with dementia from those that do not. Interannotator agreement was 0.82 (Fleiss kappa). We used the annotated tweets to train and evaluate support vector machine and deep neural network classifiers. To assess the scalability of our approach, we then deployed automatic classification on unlabeled tweets that were continuously collected between May 4, 2021, and March 9, 2022.A deep neural network classifier based on a BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) model pretrained on tweets achieved the highest F1-score of 0.962 (precision=0.946 and recall=0.979) for the class of tweets indicating that the user has a family member with dementia. The classifier detected 128,838 tweets that indicate having a family member with dementia, posted by 74,290 users between May 4, 2021, and March 9, 2022-that is, approximately 7500 users per month.Our annotated data set can be used to automatically identify Twitter users who have a family member with dementia, enabling the use of Twitter on a large scale to not only explore family caregivers' experiences but also directly target interventions at these users.",

Another experiment was designed to observe whether miconazole that has a repairing effect on myelin sheath could promote cooperative ability of APP/PS1 mice in the early AD-like stage. The protective effects of miconazole on cultured mouse cortical oligodendrocytes exposed to human amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b21-42) peptide were also investigated.There was an age-dependent impairment of cooperative drinking water behavior in APP/PS1 mice. AD mice with cooperative dysfunction showed decreases in myelin sheath thickness, oligodendrocyte nuclear heterochromatin percentage and myelin basic protein expression levels in the mPFC. The cooperative ability was significantly improved in APP/PS1 mice treated with miconazole. Miconazole treatment increased oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin sheath thickness, without reducing A\u03b2 plaque deposition, reactive gliosis and inflammatory factor levels in the mPFC.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological ailment that causes memory loss and impairments and is linked to a drop-in acetylcholine level. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are used for the management of AD. In our ongoing research to search for natural AChE inhibitors from medicinal plants, we found that the Acorus calamus possesses memory-enhancing properties. \u03b1-Asarone is the major compound isolated from the Acorus calamus and it has neuroprotective action in animal models, nonetheless, its anticholinesterase activity in different brain regions was not fully understood. The purpose of this research was to determine the anti-amnesic and anti-cholinesterase activities of \u03b1-asarone against scopolamine-induced memory impairments in rats.The anti-cholinesterase activity of \u03b1-asarone was determined using Ellman's method in different brain areas, such as the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. In addition, the anti-amnesic effect of \u03b1-asarone was also investigated using elevated plus-maze, passive avoidance, and active avoidance tests.The effect of \u03b1-asarone on memory impairment against scopolamine-induced (1 mg/kg body weight) amnesia was evaluated. Administration of \u03b1-asarone (15 and 30 mg/kg body weight) for 14 days to rats significantly ameliorated the scopolamine-induced memory impairment as measured in the elevated plus-maze, passive avoidance, and avoidance active tests compared to the scopolamine-treated group. In this study, we also show that \u03b1-asarone treatment significantly (p<0.05) reduced brain acetylcholinesterase activity in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum brain regions of amnesic rats.These results confirmed that \u03b1-asarone has anti-amnesic and anti-cholinesterase potential which may be useful for the management of AD.",

Herein, human glial chimeric mice were generated to evaluate how Alzheimer disease predisposing genetic background in human astrocytes contributes to behavioral outcome and brain pathology after cortical photothrombotic ischemia.Neonatal (P0) immunodeficient mice of both sexes were transplanted with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocyte progenitors from Alzheimer disease patients carrying PSEN1 exon 9 deletion (PSEN1 \u0394E9), with isogenic controls, with cells from a healthy donor, or with mouse astrocytes or vehicle. After 14 months, a photothrombotic lesion was produced with Rose Bengal in the motor cortex. Behavior was assessed before ischemia and 1 and 4 weeks after the induction of stroke, followed by tissue perfusion for histology.Open field, cylinder, and grid-walking tests showed a persistent locomotor and sensorimotor impairment after ischemia and female mice had larger infarct sizes; yet, these were not affected by astrocytes with PSEN1 \u0394E9 background. Staining for human nuclear antigen confirmed that human cells successfully engrafted throughout the mouse brain. However, only a small number of human cells were positive for astrocytic marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), mostly located in the corpus callosum and retaining complex human-specific morphology with longer processes compared with host counterparts. While host astrocytes formed the glial scar, human astrocytes were scattered in small numbers close to the lesion boundary. A\u03b2 (beta-amyloid) deposits were not present in PSEN1 \u0394E9 astrocyte-transplanted mice.Transplanted human cells survived and distributed widely in the host brain but had no impact on severity of ischemic damage after cortical photothrombosis in chimeric mice. Only a small number of transplanted human astrocytes acquired GFAP-positive glial phenotype or migrated toward the ischemic lesion forming glial scar.

Randomised, phase III/IV trials with \u2265100 participants were selected to quantify women's representation among participants, by computing the participation to prevalence ratio (PPR) and investigate whether sex-disaggregated analyses had been performed.A total of 1351 trials were identified between January 2010 and August 2021 (429\u2009520 participants), of which 118 were eligible for analysis of women's representation and sex-stratified analysis. Only 113 reported the sex of participants and were included in the analysis of women's representation. Of the 110\u2009469 participants in these 113 trials, 58% were women, lower than their estimated representation in the global dementia population of 64%. The mean PPR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Women's participation tended to be higher when the first or last authors of the trial report were women. Eight out of the 118 trials reported sex-disaggregated outcomes, and three of those found significant sex differences in efficacy outcomes.

Detailed knowledge on their mechanism of implication in the AD pathogenesis can help to develop novel therapeutic and disease management strategies. The two main pathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques resulting from the \u03b2-amyloid accumulation, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) due to the phosphorylated tau accumulation. Several lncRNAs and miRNAs play crucial roles in both these hallmarks of the AD pathogenesis and other AD-related pathological procedures such as neuronal and synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, neuronal differentiation and neuronal apoptosis. In this review, we outlined the non-coding RNAs and further discussed how they are implicated in these AD-related pathological procedures.",

Particularly, hypomethylation of the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) has been reported in patients with AD.In this study, we used catalytically inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused with Dnmt3a for targeted DNA methylation of APP, and showed that the CRISPR/dCas9-Dnmt3a-mediated DNA methylation system could efficiently induce targeted DNA methylation of APP both in vivo and in vitro.We hypothesized that the targeted methylation of the APP promoter might rescue AD-related neuronal cell death by reducing APP mRNA expression. The cultured APP-KI mouse primary neurons exhibited an altered DNA-methylation pattern on the APP promoter after dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment. Likewise, the APP mRNA level was significantly reduced in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated wild-type and APP-KI mouse primary neurons. We also observed decreased amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide level and A\u03b242/40 ratio in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated APP-KI mouse neurons compared to the control APP-KI mouse neurons. In addition, neuronal cell death was significantly decreased in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated APP-KI mouse neurons. Furthermore, the in vivo methylation of APP in the brain via dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment altered A\u03b2 plaques and attenuated cognitive and behavioral impairments in the\u00a0APP-KI mouse model.These results suggest that the targeted methylation of APP via dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment can be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.",

We aimed to compare the trajectories of QoL between amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative SCD or MCI patients and to evaluate QoL trajectories along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum of cognitively normal to dementia.We included longitudinal data of 447 subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 276 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 417 AD dementia patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. We compared QoL trajectories (EQ-5D and visual analog scale (VAS)) between (1) amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative SCD or MCI patients and (2) amyloid-positive SCD, MCI, and dementia patients with linear mixed-effect models. The models were adjusted for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), education, and EQ-5D scale (3 or 5 level).In SCD, amyloid-positive participants had a higher VAS at baseline but showed a steeper decline over time in EQ-5D and VAS than amyloid-negative participants. Also, in MCI, amyloid-positive patients had higher QoL at baseline but subsequently showed a steeper decline in QoL over time compared to amyloid-negative patients. When we compared amyloid-positive patients along the Alzheimer continuum, we found no difference between SCD, MCI, or dementia in baseline QoL, but QoL decreased at a faster rate in the dementia stage compared with the of SCD and MCI stages.QoL decreased at a faster rate over time in amyloid-positive SCD or MCI patients than amyloid-negative patients. QoL decreases over time along the entire AD continuum of SCD, MCI and dementia, with the strongest decrease in dementia patients.

There is also growing evidence for the prominent role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).We studied sex-specific DNA methylation differences in the blood samples of AD subjects compared to cognitively normal subjects, by performing sex-specific meta-analyses of two large blood-based epigenome-wide association studies (ADNI and AIBL), which included DNA methylation data for a total of 1284 whole blood samples (632 females and 652 males). Within each dataset, we used two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation to AD associations in male and female samples separately, and a methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. After adjusting for age, estimated immune cell type proportions, batch effects, and correcting for inflation, the inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis model was used to identify the most consistent DNAm differences across datasets. In addition, we also evaluated the performance of the sex-specific methylation-based risk prediction models for AD diagnosis using an independent external dataset.In the sex-stratified analysis, we identified 2 CpGs, mapped to the PRRC2A and RPS8 genes, significantly associated with AD in females at a 5% false discovery rate, and an additional 25 significant CpGs (21 in females, 4 in males) at P-value < 1\u00d710-5. In methylation-by-sex interaction analysis, we identified 5 significant CpGs at P-value < 10-5. Out-of-sample validations using the AddNeuroMed dataset showed in females, the best logistic prediction model included age, estimated immune cell-type proportions, and methylation risk scores (MRS) computed from 9 of the 23 CpGs identified in AD vs. CN analysis that are also available in AddNeuroMed dataset (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65-0.83). In males, the best logistic prediction model included only age and MRS computed from 2 of the 5 CpGs identified in methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that are also available in the AddNeuroMed dataset (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.82).Overall, our results show that the DNA methylation differences in AD are largely distinct between males and females. Our best-performing sex-specific methylation-based prediction model in females performed better than that for males and additionally included estimated cell-type proportions. The significant discriminatory classification of AD samples with our methylation-based prediction models demonstrates that sex-specific DNA methylation could be a predictive biomarker for AD. As sex is a strong factor underlying phenotypic variability in AD, the results of our study are particularly relevant for a better understanding of the epigenetic architecture that underlie AD and for promoting precision medicine in AD.",

In this study, we: 1) quantitatively evaluated the psychosocial health of community-dwelling OAs; 2) quantitatively evaluated the perceived stress of care partners for OAs; 3) qualitatively characterized the experiences and needs of community-dwelling OAs and their care partners; and 4) explored differences in the experiences of care partners of OAs with and without AD/ADRD during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the New York metropolitan area.In this mixed-methods study, telephone interviews were conducted with 26 OAs and 29 care partners (16 of whom cared for OAs with AD/ADRD) from April to July 2020. Quantitative data included: demographics; clinical characteristics (Katz Index of independence in activities of daily living (Katz ADL) and the Lawton-Brody instrumental activities of daily living scale (Lawton-Brody)); and psychosocial health: stress was assessed via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), social isolation via the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS), loneliness via the DeJong Loneliness Scale (DeJong), and depression and anxiety via the Patient Health Questionnaire-Anxiety and Depression (PHQ). Qualitative questions focused on uncovering the experiences and needs of OAs and their care partners.OAs (N\u2009=\u200926) were mostly female (57.7%), and White (76.9%), average age of 81.42\u2009years.

Rosmarinic acid (RA) is one of its chemical constituents known for its therapeutic potentials against cancer, inflammatory and neuronal diseases such as the treatment of neurofibromatosis or prevention from Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Despite efforts, recovery and purification of RA in high yields has not been entirely successful. Here, we report its aqueous extraction with optimal conditions and decipher the structure by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Using various physical-chemical and biological assays, we highlight its anti-aggregation inhibition potentials against the formation of Tau filaments, one of the hallmarks of AD. We then examine its anti-cancer potentials through reduction of the mitochondrial reductase activity in tumor cells and investigate its electrochemical properties by cyclic voltammetry. Our data demonstrates that RA is a prominent biologically active natural product with therapeutic potentials for drug discovery in AD, cancer therapy and inflammatory diseases.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Dysregulation of protein prenylation has been implicated in many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prenylomic analysis, the combination of metabolic incorporation of an isoprenoid analogue (C15AlkOPP) into prenylated proteins with a bottom-up proteomic analysis, has allowed the identification of prenylated proteins in various cellular models. Here, transgenic AD mice were administered with C15AlkOPP through intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion over 13 days. Using prenylomic analysis, 36 prenylated proteins were enriched in the brains of AD mice. Importantly, the prenylated forms of 15 proteins were consistently upregulated in AD mice compared to nontransgenic wild-type controls. These results highlight the power of this in vivo metabolic labeling approach to identify multiple post-translationally modified proteins that may serve as potential therapeutic targets for a disease that has proved refractory to treatment thus far. Moreover, this method should be applicable to many other types of protein modifications, significantly broadening its scope.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for dementia and Parkinson's disease (PD). Drug treatments for diabetes, such as metformin, could be used as novel treatments for these neurological conditions. Using electronic health records from the USA (OPTUM EHR) we aimed to assess the association of metformin with all-cause dementia, dementia subtypes and PD compared with sulfonylureas.A new user comparator study design was conducted in patients \u226550 years old with diabetes who were new users of metformin or sulfonylureas between 2006 and 2018. Primary outcomes were all-cause dementia and PD. Secondary outcomes were Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to estimate the HRs. Subanalyses included stratification by age, race, renal function, and glycemic control.We identified 96\u2009140 and 16\u2009451 new users of metformin and sulfonylureas, respectively. Mean age was 66.4\u00b18.2 years (48% male, 83% Caucasian). Over the 5-year follow-up, 3207 patients developed all-cause dementia (2256 (2.3%) metformin, 951 (5.8%) sulfonylurea users) and 760 patients developed PD (625 (0.7%) metformin, 135 (0.8%) sulfonylurea users). After IPTW, HRs for all-cause dementia and PD were 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.88) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.28). HRs for AD, VD and MCI were 0.81 (0.70-0.94), 0.79 (0.63-1.00) and 0.91 (0.79-1.04). Stronger associations were observed in patients who were younger (<75 years old), Caucasian, and with moderate renal function.Metformin users compared with sulfonylurea users were associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, AD and VD but not with PD or MCI. Age and renal function modified risk reduction. Our findings support the hypothesis that metformin provides more neuroprotection for dementia than sulfonylureas but not for PD, but further work is required to assess causality.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, with resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability being major symptoms1. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by the presence of abundant filamentous inclusions of \u03b1-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in some brain cells, including dopaminergic nerve cells of the substantia nigra2. PD is increasingly recognised as a multisystem disorder, with cognitive decline being one of its most common non-motor symptoms. Many patients with PD develop dementia more than 10 years after diagnosis3. PD dementia (PDD) is clinically and neuropathologically similar to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is diagnosed when cognitive impairment precedes parkinsonian motor signs or begins within one year from their onset4. In PDD, cognitive impairment develops in the setting of well-established PD. Besides PD and DLB, multiple system atrophy (MSA) is the third major synucleinopathy5. It is characterized by the presence of abundant filamentous \u03b1-synuclein inclusions in brain cells, especially oligodendrocytes (Papp-Lantos bodies). We previously reported the electron cryo-microscopy structures of two types of \u03b1-synuclein filament extracted from the brains of individuals with MSA6. Each filament type is made of two different protofilaments. Here we report that the cryo-electron microscopy structures of \u03b1-synuclein filaments from the brains of individuals with PD, PDD and DLB are made of a single protofilament (Lewy fold) that is markedly different from the protofilaments of MSA. These findings establish the existence of distinct molecular conformers of assembled \u03b1-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease.",

Thus, we investigated the anti-Alzheimer's disease (anti-AD) potential of 16 ellagitannin and gallotannin, and nine anthocyanin derivatives' inhibition of BACE1, AChE, and BChE, and gallagic acid inhibited both the best. Further, a kinetic study identified different modes of inhibition, and a molecular docking simulation revealed that active compounds inhibited these three enzymes with low binding energy through hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions in the active site cavities. Gallagic acid and castalagin decreased A\u03b2 peptides secretion from neuroblastoma cells that overexpressed human \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein significantly by 10\u00a0\u03bcM. Further, treatment with gallagic acid and castalagin reduced BACE1 and APPs\u03b2 expression levels significantly without affecting amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in the amyloidogenic pathway. Co-incubation of A\u03b242 with gallagic acid reduced A\u03b242-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production significantly.

Patchouli alcohol (PA), a major active ingredient isolated from Pogostemonis Herba, exhibits extensive bioactivity in the central nervous system (CNS) and exerts neuroprotective effects.This study aimed to investigate the anti-AD effects of PA in an animal model of AD and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.The gas chromatography (GC) was used to determine the ability of PA to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rats after oral administration. The sporadic AD rat model was established by intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection with streptozotocin (STZ). PA (25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg) was given to rat orally once daily for 42 consecutive days. Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to determine the learning and memory functions of the STZ-induced AD rats. EX527, a silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) selective inhibitor, was used to investigate the involvement of SIRT1 in the anti-AD effects of PA in rats.PA could penetrate the BBB. MWM test results showed that PA could significantly ameliorate the learning and memory deficits induced by STZ in rats. Meanwhile, PA enhanced the expression of SIRT1, and markedly alleviated the tau pathology by inhibiting the hyperacetylation (at the site of Lys174) and hyperphosphorylation (at the sites of Thr181, Thr205, Ser396 and Ser404) of tau protein. PA also efficiently suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) expression and the deacetylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) at Lys 310 (K310) in the STZ-treated AD rats. EX527, a SIRT1 selective inhibitor, could partially abolish the cognitive deficits improving effect of PA and inhibit the down-regulation of acetylated tau and acetylated NF-\u03baB p65, suggesting that PA exhibited neuroprotective effects against AD via upregulating SIRT1.This study reported for the first time that PA could penetrate the BBB to exert its protective effects on the brain after a single-dose oral administration. The current experimental findings also amply demonstrated that PA could improve the cognitive and memory impairments in the STZ-induced AD rat model. The underlying mechanisms involve the alleviations of neuroinflammation, tau pathology and A\u03b2 deposition via modulating of SIRT1 and NF-\u03baB pathways. All these findings strongly suggest that PA is a promising naturally occurring compound worthy of further development into an anti-AD pharmaceutical.",

We developed an ordered probit transition model to predict future TICS27 score. This transition model is utilized in the Future Elderly Model (FEM), a dynamic microsimulation model of health and health-related economic outcomes for the US population. We validated the FEM TICS27 model using a five-fold cross validation approach, by comparing 10-year (2006-2016) simulated outcomes against observed HRS data.In aggregate, the distribution of TICS27 scores after ten years of FEM simulation matches the HRS. FEM's assignment of cognitive/mortality status also matches those observed in HRS on the population level. At the individual level, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve is 0.904 for prediction of dementia or dead with dementia in 10 years, the AUROC for predicting significant cognitive decline in two years for mild cognitive impairment patients is 0.722.The FEM TICS27 model demonstrates its predictive accuracy for both two- and ten-year cognitive outcomes.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Experimental observations have suggested a role of infection in the etiology of neurodegenerative disease. In human studies, however, it is difficult to disentangle whether infection is a risk factor or rather a comorbidity or secondary event of neurodegenerative disease. To this end, we examined the risk of 3 most common neurodegenerative diseases in relation to previous inpatient or outpatient episodes of hospital-treated infections.We performed a nested case-control study based on several national registers in Sweden. Cases were individuals newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) during 1970 to 2016 in Sweden, identified from the National Patient Register. For each case, 5 controls individually matched to the case on sex and year of birth were randomly selected from the general population. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with adjustment for potential confounders, including sex, year of birth, area of residence, educational attainment, family history of neurodegenerative disease, and Charlson comorbidity index. Infections experienced within 5 years before diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease were excluded to reduce the influence of surveillance bias and reverse causation. The analysis included 291,941 AD cases (median age at diagnosis: 76.2 years; male: 46.6%), 103,919 PD cases (74.3; 55.1%), and 10,161 ALS cases (69.3; 56.8%). A hospital-treated infection 5 or more years earlier was associated with an increased risk of AD (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.18, P < 0.001) and PD (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.06, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for bacterial, viral, and other infections and among different sites of infection including gastrointestinal and genitourinary infections. Multiple infections before age 40 conveyed the greatest risk of AD (OR = 2.62, 95% CI: 2.52 to 2.72, P < 0.001) and PD (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.53, P < 0.001). The associations were primarily due to AD and PD diagnosed before 60 years (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.89 to 1.98 for AD, P < 0.001; OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.36 for PD, P < 0.001), whereas no association was found for those diagnosed at 60 years or older (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.01 for AD, P = 0.508; OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.03 for PD, P = 0.382). No association was observed for ALS (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.03, P = 0.384), regardless of age at diagnosis. Excluding infections experienced within 10 years before diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease confirmed these findings. Study limitations include the potential misclassification of hospital-treated infections and neurodegenerative diseases due to incomplete coverage of the National Patient Register, as well as the residual confounding from unmeasured risk or protective factors for neurodegenerative diseases.Hospital-treated infections, especially in early- and mid-life, were associated with an increased risk of AD and PD, primarily among AD and PD cases diagnosed before 60 years. These findings suggest that infectious events may be a trigger or amplifier of a preexisting disease process, leading to clinical onset of neurodegenerative disease at a relatively early age. However, due to the observational nature of the study, these results do not formally prove a causal link.",

IIV-d was calculated via the intra-individual standard deviation across 12 primary UDS3NB indicators. Separate models using mean USD3NB score and the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) total score tested the reproducibility of the incremental value of IIV-d over-and-above global cognition. Binary logistic regressions tested whether IIV-d could classify individuals with and without clinician-rated cognitive fluctuations. Multinomial logistic regressions tested whether IIV-d could differentiate participants with DLB, participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and participants with healthy cognition (CH), as well as the incremental diagnostic utility of IIV-d over-and-above clinician-rated cognitive fluctuations.IIV-d exhibited large univariate associations with clinician-rated and non-clinician-informant reported cognitive fluctuations, which persisted when adjusting for MoCA but not the full battery mean. Of diagnostic relevance, greater IIV-d was consistently associated with DLB and AD relative to CH over-and-above global cognition and clinician-rated cognitive fluctuations. Greater IIV-d was less consistently associated with an increased probability of DLB relative to AD when controlling for global cognition.IIV-d accurately differentiates DLB from CH over-and-above global cognition and clinician-rated cognitive fluctuations. IIV-d may supplement a thorough clinical interview of cognitive fluctuations and serve as a standardized performance-based indicator of this transdiagnostic phenomenon.

As microglial responses modulated by TREM2 are central to AD pathogenesis, enhancing TREM2 signaling has been explored as an AD therapeutic strategy. However, the effective therapeutic window targeting TREM2 is unclear. Here, by using microglia-specific inducible mouse models overexpressing human wild-type TREM2 (TREM2-WT) or R47H risk variant (TREM2-R47H), we show that TREM2-WT expression reduces amyloid deposition and neuritic dystrophy only during the early amyloid seeding stage, whereas TREM2-R47H exacerbates amyloid burden during the middle amyloid rapid growth stage. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals suppressed disease-associated microglia (DAM) signature and reduced DAM population upon TREM2-WT expression in the early stage, whereas upregulated antigen presentation pathway is detected with TREM2-R47H expression in the middle stage. Together, our findings highlight the dynamic effects of TREM2 in modulating AD pathogenesis and emphasize the beneficial effect of enhancing TREM2 function in the early stage of AD development.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are a cluster of progressive, severe, and disabling disorders that affect millions of people worldwide and are on the surge. These disorders are characterized by the gradual loss of a selectively vulnerable group of neurons. Due to the complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind neurodegeneration and despite enormous efforts and understanding of the occurrence and progression of NDs, there is still a lack of an effective treatment for such diseases. Therefore, the development of a new therapeutic strategy for NDs is an unmet clinical need. Various natural compounds extracted from medicinal plants or fruits have shown promising activities in treating different types of NDs by targeting multiple signaling pathways. Among natural entities, flavonoids have incited a rise in public and scientific interest in recent years because of their purported health-promoting effects. Dietary supplementation of flavonoids has been shown to mitigate the severity of NDs such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and dementia by their antioxidant effects. Naringenin is a citrus flavonoid that is known to possess numerous biological activities like antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, naringenin has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent that exerts preventive and curative effects on several neurological disorders. Increasing evidence has attained special attention on the variety of therapeutic targets along with complex signaling pathways of naringenin, which suggest its possible therapeutic applications in several NDs. Derived from the results of several pre-clinical research and considering the therapeutic effects of this compound, this review focuses on the potential role of naringenin as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The overall neuroprotective effects and different possible underlying mechanisms related to naringenin are discussed. In the light of substantial evidence for naringenin's neuroprotective efficacy in several experimental paradigms, this review suggests that this molecule should be investigated further as a viable candidate for the management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with an emphasis on mechanistic and clinical trials to determine its efficacy. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Naringenin is a flavanone, aglycone of Naringin, predominantly found in citrus fruits with a variety of pharmacological actions. Naringenin has been shown to exhibit remarkable therapeutic efficacy and has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of a variety of diseases such as various heart, liver, and metabolic disorders. Similarly, it has shown efficacy in neurodegenerative illnesses. Therefore, this review enables us to better understand the neuroprotective effects and different possible underlying mechanisms of naringenin. Also, this review provides a new indication to manage the symptoms of NDs like AD and PD. Furthermore, naringenin will be useful in the field of medicine as a new active ingredient for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like AD and PD.",

Cox proportional hazards models were run to test associations between improvement in depression following psychological therapy and incidence of dementia diagnosis up to eight years later.Improvements in depression following treatment were associated with reduced rates of dementia diagnosis up to 8 years later (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94), after adjustment for key covariates. Strongest effects were observed for vascular dementia (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.97) compared with Alzheimer's disease (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00).Reliable improvement in depression across psychological therapy was associated with reduced incidence of future dementia. Results are consistent with at least two possibilities. Firstly, psychological interventions to improve symptoms of depression may have the potential to contribute to dementia risk reduction efforts. Secondly, psychological therapies may be less effective in people with underlying dementia pathology or they may be more likely to drop out of therapy (reverse causality). Tackling the under-representation of older people in psychological therapies and optimizing therapy outcomes is an important goal for future research.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "It remains unclear whether persistent loneliness is related to brain structures that are associated with cognitive decline and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the relationships between different loneliness types, cognitive functioning, and regional brain volumes.Loneliness was measured longitudinally, using the item from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale in the Framingham Heart Study, Generation 3, with participants' average age of 46\u00b73 \u00b1 8\u00b76 years. Robust regression models tested the association between different loneliness types with longitudinal neuropsychological performance (n = 2,609) and regional magnetic resonance imaging brain data (n = 1,829) (2002-2019). Results were stratified for sex, depression, and Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4).Persistent loneliness, but not transient loneliness, was strongly associated with cognitive decline, especially memory and executive function. Persistent loneliness was negatively associated with temporal lobe volume (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.18, 95%CI [-0.32, -0.04], P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b701). Among women, persistent loneliness was associated with smaller frontal lobe (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.19, 95%CI [-0.38, -0.01], P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b704), temporal lobe (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.20, 95%CI [-0.37, -0.03], P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b702), and hippocampus volumes (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.23, 95%CI [-0.40, -0.06], P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7007), and larger lateral ventricle volume (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.15, 95%CI [0.02, 0.28], P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b703). The higher cumulative loneliness scores across three exams, the smaller parietal, temporal, and hippocampus volumes and larger lateral ventricle were evident, especially in the presence of ApoE4.Persistent loneliness in midlife was associated with atrophy in brain regions responsible for memory and executive dysfunction. Interventions to reduce the chronicity of loneliness may mitigate the risk of age-related cognitive decline and AD.US National Institute on Aging.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative process with multifactorial characteristics. This disease follows the natural aging process, affecting mainly people over 65 years. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment currently combats symptoms related to cognitive function. Several targets have begun to attract the interest of the scientific community to develop new drug candidates which have better pharmacokinetic and lower toxicity parameters.The present study aims to design new candidates for acetylcholinesterase/\u03b2-secretase (AChE/BACE1) multitarget inhibitor drugs.17 natural products were selected from the literature with anticholinesterase activity and 1 synthetic molecule with inhibitory activity for BACE1. Subsequently, the molecular docking study was performed, followed by the derivation of the pharmacophoric pattern and prediction of pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties. Finally, the hybrid prototype was designed.All selected molecules showed interactions with their respective target enzymes. Derivation of the pharmacophoric pattern from molecules that interacted with the AChE enzyme resulted in 3 pharmacophoric regions: an aromatic ring, an electron-acceptor region and a hydrophobic region. The molecules showed good pharmacokinetic and toxicological results, showing no warnings of mutagenicity and/or carcinogenicity. After the hybridization process, three hybrid molecules were obtained, which showed inhibitory activity for both targets.It is concluded that research in the field of medicinal chemistry is advancing towards the discovery of new drug candidates that bring a better quality of life to patients with AD.",

Here, we report that coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 6 (CHCHD6), a core protein of the mammalian mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system, mechanistically connects these AD features through a circular feedback loop that lowers CHCHD6 and raises APP processing. In cellular and animal AD models and human AD brains, the APP intracellular domain fragment inhibits CHCHD6 transcription by binding its promoter. CHCHD6 and APP bind and stabilize one another. Reduced CHCHD6 enhances APP accumulation on mitochondria-associated ER membranes and accelerates APP processing, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cholesterol accumulation, promoting amyloid pathology. Compensation for CHCHD6 loss in an AD mouse model reduces AD-associated neuropathology and cognitive impairment. Thus, CHCHD6 connects APP processing and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. This provides a potential new therapeutic target for patients.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Amyloid fibril formation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Transient prefibrillar oligomers forming during the aggregation process, exhibiting a small size and a large hydrophobic surface, can aberrantly interact with a number of molecular targets on neurons, including the lipid bilayer of plasma membranes, resulting in a fatal outcome for the cells. By contrast, the mature fibrils, despite presenting generally a high hydrophobic surface, are endowed with a low diffusion rate and poorly penetrate the interior of the lipid bilayer. However, increasing evidence shows that both intracellular \u03b1-synuclein fibrils, as well and as extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 and \u03b22-microglobulin fibrils, can release oligomers over time that quickly diffuse to reach the membrane of the neighboring cells. The persistent leakage of harmful oligomers from fibrils triggers an ongoing cascade of events resulting in a sustained injury to neurons and glia and also provides aggregates with the ability to cross biological membranes and diffuse between cells or cellular compartments.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been rapidly increasing worldwide. We have developed a novel angiogenic therapy with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), which is effective and safe in animal models of AD and vascular dementia. We performed two trials of LIPUS therapy for AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD and mild AD); a roll-in open trial for safety, and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (RCT) trial for efficacy and safety. The LIPUS therapy was performed for whole brain through the bilateral temporal bones for one hour 3 times a week as one session under the special conditions (1.3 MPa, 32 cycles, 5% duty cycle) we identified. The LIPUS therapy was performed for one session in the roll-in trial, and 6 sessions in the RCT trial with 3-month intervals for 1.5 years. The primary endpoint was ADAS-J cog scores. The RCT trial was terminated prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the roll-in trial (N = 5), no adverse effects were noted. In the RCT trial (N = 22), the worsening of ADAS-J cog scores tended to be suppressed in the LIPUS group compared with the placebo group at week 72 (P = 0.257). When responders were defined as those with no worsening of ADAS-J cog scores at week 72, the prevalence was 50% (5/10) and 0% (0/5) in the LIPUS and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.053). No adverse effects were noted. These results suggest that the LIPUS therapy is safe and tends to suppress cognitive impairment although a next pivotal trial with a large number of subjects is warranted.",

Impairment in allocentric processing may help identify those at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease dementia. The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of participants with and without diabetes on a task of allocentric spatial processing. This was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis study using baseline data from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia Longitudinal Cohort Study (EPAD LCS). Participants were aged 50\u2009years and above and were free of dementia at baseline. Participants with no missing data on the variables of interest were included in this study. Our exposure variable was diabetes reported in the medical history. Our primary outcome was the Four Mountains Test (4MT), a novel task of allocentric processing. Covariates included demographics (age, sex, family history of dementia and years of education), APOE\u03b54 carrier status, cognitive status (Clinical Dementia Rating scale), cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau and amyloid-beta 1-42. Of 1324 participants (mean age\u2009=\u200965.95 (\u00b17.45)), 90 had diabetes. Participants with diabetes scored 8.32 (\u00b12.32) on the 4MT compared with 9.24 (\u00b12.60) for participants without diabetes. In a univariate model, diabetes was significantly associated with worse 4MT total scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u2009-.92, p\u00a0=\u2009.001), remaining significant in a fully adjusted model (\u03b2\u00a0=\u2009-.64, p\u00a0=\u2009.01). Cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau was significantly higher in participants with diabetes compared with those without. Novel cognitive tests, such as the 4MT, may be appropriate to identify early cognitive changes in this high-risk group.

This study investigates if pre-analytical treatment of blood and CSF contribute to these unexpected findings.Paired CSF and serum samples from 49 individuals (A\u03b2-negative = 28; A\u03b2-positive = 21) underwent a series of seven freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). All samples were analyzed for GFAP and neurofilament light (NfL) using single molecule array technology including a fresh unfrozen sample from each patient.FTC significantly affected CSF GFAP concentration (-188.12 pg/ml per FTC) but not serum GFAP. In the same samples, NfL remained stable. Serum GFAP had a higher discrimination of A\u03b2 burden than CSF GFAP, irrespective of FTC, which also included unfrozen samples.This study demonstrates large stability differences of GFAP in CSF and serum. However, this disparity does not seem to fully explain the stronger association of serum GFAP with A\u03b2 pathology.

        "ArticleAbstract": "A neuroimaging-based biomarker termed the brain age is thought to reflect variability in the brain's ageing process and predict longevity. Using Insight 46, a unique narrow-age birth cohort, we aimed to examine potential drivers and correlates of brain age.Participants, born in a single week in 1946 in mainland Britain, have had 24 prospective waves of data collection to date, including MRI and amyloid PET imaging at approximately 70 years old. Using MRI data from a previously defined selection of this cohort, we derived brain-predicted age from an established machine-learning model (trained on 2001 healthy adults aged 18-90 years); subtracting this from chronological age (at time of assessment) gave the brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD). We tested associations with data from early life, midlife, and late life, as well as rates of MRI-derived brain atrophy.Between May 28, 2015, and Jan 10, 2018, 502 individuals were assessed as part of Insight 46. We included 456 participants (225 female), with a mean chronological age of 70\u00b77 years (SD 0\u00b77; range 69\u00b72 to 71\u00b79). The mean brain-predicted age was 67\u00b79 years (8\u00b72, 46\u00b73 to 94\u00b73). Female sex was associated with a 5\u00b74-year (95% CI 4\u00b71 to 6\u00b78) younger brain-PAD than male sex. An increase in brain-PAD was associated with increased cardiovascular risk at age 36 years (\u03b2=2\u00b73 [95% CI 1\u00b75 to 3\u00b70]) and 69 years (\u03b2=2\u00b76 [1\u00b79 to 3\u00b73]); increased cerebrovascular disease burden (1\u00b79 [1\u00b73 to 2\u00b76]); lower cognitive performance (-1\u00b73 [-2\u00b74 to -0\u00b72]); and increased serum neurofilament light concentration (1\u00b72 [0\u00b76 to 1\u00b79]). Higher brain-PAD was associated with future hippocampal atrophy over the subsequent 2 years (0\u00b7003 mL/year [0\u00b7000 to 0\u00b7006] per 5-year increment in brain-PAD). Early-life factors did not relate to brain-PAD. Combining 12 metrics in a hierarchical partitioning model explained 33% of the variance in brain-PAD.Brain-PAD was associated with cardiovascular risk, and imaging and biochemical markers of neurodegeneration. These findings support brain-PAD as an integrative summary metric of brain health, reflecting multiple contributions to pathological brain ageing, and which might have prognostic utility.Alzheimer's Research UK, Medical Research Council Dementia Platforms UK, Selfridges Group Foundation, Wolfson Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Brain Research UK, Alzheimer's Association.",

COSMOS-Mind tested whether daily administration of cocoa extract (containing 500\u00a0mg/day flavanols) versus placebo and a commercial multivitamin-mineral (MVM) versus placebo improved cognition in older women and men.COSMOS-Mind, a large randomized two-by-two factorial 3-year trial, assessed cognition by telephone at baseline and annually. The primary outcome was a global cognition composite formed from mean standardized (z) scores (relative to baseline) from individual tests, including the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status, Word List and Story Recall, Oral Trail-Making, Verbal Fluency, Number Span, and Digit Ordering. Using intention-to-treat, the primary endpoint was change in this composite with 3 years of cocoa extract use. The pre-specified secondary endpoint was change in the composite with 3 years of MVM supplementation. Treatment effects were also examined for executive function and memory composite scores, and in pre-specified subgroups at higher risk for cognitive decline.A total of 2262 participants were enrolled (mean age\u00a0=\u00a073y; 60% women; 89% non-Hispanic White), and 92% completed the baseline and at least one annual assessment. Cocoa extract had no effect on global cognition (mean z-score\u00a0=\u00a00.03, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.08; P =\u00a0.28). Daily MVM supplementation, relative to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant benefit on global cognition (mean z\u00a0=\u00a00.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12; P =\u00a0.007), and this effect was most pronounced in participants with a history of cardiovascular disease (no history: 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; history: 0.14, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.31; interaction, nominal P =\u00a0.01). Multivitamin-mineral benefits were also observed for memory and executive function. The cocoa extract by MVM group interaction was not significant for any of the cognitive composites.Cocoa extract did not benefit cognition. However, COSMOS-Mind provides the first evidence from a large, long-term, pragmatic trial to support the potential efficacy of a MVM to improve cognition in older adults. Additional work is needed to confirm these findings in a more diverse cohort and to identify mechanisms to account for MVM effects.COSMOS-Mind was a large simple pragmatic randomized clinical trial in older adults conducted by mail and telephone. The trial used a two-by-two factorial design to assess treatment effects of two different interventions within a single large study. We found no cognitive benefit of daily cocoa extract administration (containing 500\u00a0mg flavanols) for 3 years. Daily multivitamin-mineral (MVM) supplementation for 3 years improved global cognition, episodic memory, and executive function in older adults.

        "ArticleTitle": "Chemical traits of cerebral amyloid angiopathy in familial British-, Danish-, and non-Alzheimer's dementias.",
        "ArticleAbstract": "Familial British dementia (FBD) and familial Danish dementia (FDD) are autosomal dominant forms of dementia caused by mutations in the integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2B, also known as BRI2) gene. Secretase processing of mutant BRI2 leads to secretion and deposition of BRI2-derived amyloidogenic peptides, ABri and ADan that resemble APP/\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) pathology, which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid pathology in FBD/FDD manifests itself predominantly in the microvasculature by ABri/ADan containing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). While ABri and ADan peptide sequences differ only in a few C-terminal amino acids, CAA in FDD is characterized by co-aggregation of ADan with A\u03b2, while in contrast no A\u03b2 deposition is observed in FBD. The fact that FDD patients display an earlier and more severe disease onset than FBD suggests a potential role of ADan and A\u03b2 co-aggregation that promotes a more rapid disease progression in FDD compared to FBD. It is therefore critical to delineate the chemical signatures of amyloid aggregation in these two vascular dementias. This in turn will increase the knowledge on the pathophysiology of these diseases and the pathogenic role of heterogenous amyloid peptide interactions and deposition, respectively. Herein, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) in combination with hyperspectral, confocal microscopy based on luminescent conjugated oligothiophene probes (LCO) to delineate the structural traits and associated amyloid peptide patterns of single CAA in postmortem brain tissue of patients with FBD, FDD as well as sporadic CAA without AD (CAA+) that show pronounced CAA without parenchymal plaques. The results show that CAA in both FBD and FDD consist of N-terminally truncated- and pyroglutamate-modified amyloid peptide species (ADan and ABri), but that ADan peptides in FDD are also extensively C-terminally truncated as compared to ABri in FBD, which contributes to hydrophobicity of ADan species. Further, CAA in FDD showed co-deposition with A\u03b2 x-42 and A\u03b2 x-40 species. CAA+ vessels were structurally more mature than FDD/FBD CAA and contained significant amounts of pyroglutamated A\u03b2. When compared with FDD, A\u03b2 in CAA+ showed more C-terminal and less N-terminally truncations. In FDD, ADan showed spatial co-localization with A\u03b23pE-40 and A\u03b23-40 but not with A\u03b2x-42 species. This suggests an increased aggregation propensity of A\u03b2 in FDD that promotes co-aggregation of both A\u03b2 and ADan. Further, CAA maturity appears to be mainly governed by A\u03b2 content based on the significantly higher 500/580 patterns observed in CAA+ than in FDD and FBD, respectively. Together this is the first study of its kind on comprehensive delineation of Bri2 and APP-derived amyloid peptides in single vascular plaques in both FDD/FBD and sporadic CAA that provides new insight in non-AD-related vascular amyloid pathology.

Here, we report neuropathological findings of a PA patient. The patient was a male infant who presented with increasing lethargy and poor feeding from four days postpartum. He gradually became comatose and died from complications after liver transplantation at three months old. The results of laboratory examination were consistent with PA, and genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the gene for PCC subunit beta: c.838dupC (rs769968548) and c.1127G>T (rs142982097). Brain-restricted autopsy was performed 23\u2009h after his death, and the neuropathological examination revealed distinct astrocytosis, oligodendrocytic loss, neuronal loss, and demyelination across the brainstem, motor cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Spongiosis, vacuolization, and the appearance of Alzheimer type II astrocytes and activated microglia were observed as well. This is the first brain autopsy report of PA with a clear genetic cause.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "As the field of stem cell therapy advances, it is important to develop reliable methods to overcome host immune responses in animal models. This ensures survival of transplanted human stem cell grafts and enables predictive efficacy testing. Immunosuppressive drugs derived from clinical protocols are frequently used but are often inconsistent and associated with toxic side effects. Here, using a molecular imaging approach, we show that immunosuppression targeting costimulatory molecules CD4 and CD40L enables robust survival of human xenografts in mouse brain, as compared to conventional tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.Human neural stem cells were modified to express green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase. Cells were implanted in the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus and viability assessed by non-invasive bioluminescent imaging. Cell survival was assessed using traditional pharmacologic immunosuppression as compared to monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4 and CD40L. This paradigm was also implemented in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model.Graft rejection occurs within 7 days in non-immunosuppressed mice and within 14 days in mice on a traditional regimen. The addition of dual monoclonal antibody immunosuppression extends graft survival past 7 weeks (p < .001) on initial studies. We confirm dual monoclonal antibody treatment is superior to either antibody alone (p < .001). Finally, we demonstrate robust xenograft survival at multiple cell doses up to 6 months in both C57BL/6J mice and a transgenic Alzheimer's disease model (p < .001). The dual monoclonal antibody protocol demonstrated no significant adverse effects, as determined by complete blood counts and toxicity screen.This study demonstrates an effective immunosuppression protocol for preclinical testing of stem cell therapies. A transition towards antibody-based strategies may be advantageous by enabling stem cell survival in preclinical studies that could inform future clinical trials.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Immune system dysregulation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, even considered to be as important as classical pathological protein aggregation assumption. However, the associations of immune-mediated diseases with incident dementia are unclear and need to be clarified in prospective studies with a large population and long follow-up time.We investigated the relationship between any or individual immune-mediated diseases and incident dementia based on a prospective cohort UK Biobank. The risk for dementia was assessed with multivariable hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) after adjusting for various potential confounders using time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression. We also performed the subgroup Cox analysis stratified by time since immune-mediated diseases and gender. Causal mediation analyses with 1000 bootstrapped iterations were conducted to explore the mediation effects of peripheral immune cells on the associations of immune-mediated diseases with dementia.A total of 375,894 participants were included in the study, among which 5291 developed dementia during a median follow-up of 9.08\u00a0years. Immune-mediated diseases were associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21), and the risk was highest between 1 and 2\u00a0years after immune-mediated diseases onset (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.86-4.04). Females who suffered from immune-mediated diseases were more prone to AD, while males were more susceptible to VD. Four of the individual immune-mediated diseases including type I diabetes mellitus (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.97-3.15), rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart diseases (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.77), multiple sclerosis (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.92-4.30), and necrotizing vasculopathies (HR, 1.71; 95%CI, 1.03-2.85) were significantly related to higher dementia incidence. The relationship between immune-mediated diseases and dementia was partially mediated by peripheral immune cells including neutrophils and lymphocytes.In this large cohort study, immune-mediated diseases were proven to be significantly associated with an increased risk of incident dementia, especially for type I diabetes mellitus which was observed to be related to the higher incidence of all types of dementia. Our findings could provide new sights on dementia pathogenesis and intervention from the perspective of systemic immunology and immune-mediated diseases.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Neurodegeneration is the loss of neuronal capacity and structure over time which causes neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson, and Huntington's disease (HD). This review is primarily concerned with HD, which was fully described by George Huntington in 1872. In developed countries, HD has become another common single-gene neurological disorder. Because of its autosomal dominant inheritance, the sickness affects both individuals and their families. Huntington disease has been recognized as a disorder that affects the complete body and brain in which the mutant huntingtin polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence is extensively increased and gets correlated to CAG trinucleotide which codes for glutamine (Q). These proteins have characteristics that produce apoptosis and dysfunction. HD is a lethal condition which needs an immediate diagnosis and treatment, and therefore, nanoparticle has come into sight out as opportunistic strategies for treatment of HD. Nanostructures have great potential to cross the blood brain barrier and also prevent breakdown of active molecule and reduces the drug toxicity. This review explains the distinguishing symptoms, genetics, and stages during the development of Huntington's disease, and also provides an overview of HD with an emphasis on its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management. This review focuses on the latest studies on nanotechnology-related technologies, i.e., magnetic nanoparticle, solid lipid nanoparticle, and polymeric nanoparticle for Huntington's disease treatment. The pioneering patents and in-progress clinical trials related to Huntington's disease has also been summarized in this review.",

        "ArticleAbstract": "Substances from the Cannabis sativa species, especially cannabidiol (CBD) and Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), have attracted medical attention in recent years. The actions of these two main cannabinoids modulate the cholinergic nervous system (CholNS) involving development, synaptic plasticity, and response to endogenous and environmental damage, as a characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases. The dynamics of these diseases are mediated by specific neurotransmitters, such as the GABAergic nervous system (GNS) and the CholNS. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an important experimental model, which has different neurotransmitter systems that coordinate its behavior and has a transgene strain that encodes the human \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 peptide in body wall muscle, one of the main proteins involved in Alzheimer\u00b4s disease. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the protective potential of terpenoids found in C. sativa in the GNS and CholNS of C. elegans. The effect of two C. sativa oils with variations in CBD and THC concentrations on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation, and behavior of C. elegans was evaluated. C. sativa oils were efficient in increasing pharyngeal pumping rate and reducing defecation cycle, AChE activity, and ROS levels in N2 strains. In the muscle:Abeta1-42 strain, mainly when using CBD oil, worm movement, body bends, and pharyngeal pumping were increased, with a reduced AChE activity. Consequently, greater investments in scientific research are needed, in addition to breaking the taboo on the use of the C. sativa plant as an alternative for medicinal use, especially in neurodegenerative diseases, which have already shown positive initial results.",

Approximately 50 million individuals are affected by AD, and the number is rapidly increasing globally. This review explores the role of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the management of AD and its clinical manifestations.This review aims to provide a deep insight into the recent progress in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and its use against neurodegenerative disorders, specifically AD. However, we have referred to its use against parkinsons's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and other human diseases, as is one of the most promising and emerging technologies for disease treatment.The pathophysiology of AD is known to be linked with gene mutations, that is, presenilin (PSEN) and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). However, clinical trials focused at the genetic level could not meet the desired efficiency. The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool is one of the most powerful technologies for correcting inconsistent genetic signatures and now extensively used for AD management. It has significant potential for the correction of undesired gene mutations associated with AD. This technology has allowed the development of empirical AD models, therapeutic lines, and diagnostic approaches for better understanding the nervous system, from in vitro to in vivo models.",

Mutations in SORL1, encoding the endosome recycling receptor SORLA, are found in 2%-3% of individuals with early-onset AD, and SORL1 haploinsufficiency appears to be causal for AD. To test whether SORL1 can function as an AD causal gene, we use CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing to develop a model of SORL1 haploinsufficiency in G\u00f6ttingen minipigs, taking advantage of porcine models for biomarker investigations. SORL1 haploinsufficiency in young adult minipigs is found to phenocopy the preclinical in\u00a0vivo profile of AD observed with APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, resulting in elevated levels of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau preceding amyloid plaque formation and neurodegeneration, as observed in humans.

        "ArticleAbstract": "Eleven tau immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have entered clinical trials to treat tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, but it is unclear which IgG subclass/subtype has the ideal efficacy and safety profile. Only two subtypes, with or without effector function, have been examined in the clinic and not for the same tau antibody. The few preclinical studies on this topic have only compared two subtypes of one antibody each and have yielded conflicting results.We selected two single domain antibodies (sdAbs) derived from a llama immunized with tau proteins and utilized them to generate an array of Fc-(sdAb)2 subclasses containing identical tau binding domains but differing Fc region. Unmodified sdAbs and their IgG subclasses were tested for efficacy in primary cultures and in vivo microdialysis using JNPL3 tauopathy mice.Unmodified sdAbs were non-toxic, blocked tau toxicity and promoted tau clearance. However, the efficacy/safety profile of their Fc-(sdAb)2 subclasses varied greatly within and between sdAbs. For one of them, all its subtypes were non-toxic, only those with effector function cleared tau, and were more effective in vivo than unmodified sdAb. For the other sdAb, all its subtypes were toxic in tauopathy cultures but not in wild-type cells, suggesting that bivalent binding of its tau epitope stabilizes a toxic conformation of tau, with major implications for tau pathogenesis. Likewise, its subclasses were less effective than the unmodified sdAb in clearing tau in vivo.These findings indicate that tau antibodies with effector function are safe and better at clearing pathological tau than effectorless antibodies, Furthermore, tau antibodies can provide a valuable insight into tau pathogenesis, and some may aggravate it.Funding for these studies was provided by the National Institute of Health (R01 AG032611, R01 NS077239, RF1 NS120488, R21 AG 069475, R21 AG 058282, T32AG052909), and the NYU Alzheimer's Disease Center Pilot Grant Program (via P30 AG008051).",

The risk of AD according to BMI category (kg/m2) in Asians was evaluated using a multivariable Cox regression model, after adjustments for age, sex, lifestyle, low-income status, and comorbidities. To evaluate the association between BMI and AD risk, the underweight population was further subdivided according to the degree of thinness. During the 10-year follow-up period, 22,279 individuals developed AD. Relative to the normal-weight population, the estimated adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incident AD in the underweight, overweight, and obese populations was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.24), 0.90 (0.87-0.93), and 0.83 (0.80-0.85), respectively. In the underweight population, AD risk increased as the degree of thinness increased (p for the trend,\u2009<\u2009.001). Late-life BMI showed a significant inverse relationship with AD risk, especially in the underweight population.
