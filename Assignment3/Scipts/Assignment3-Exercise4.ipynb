    " The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). I chose the HINTS 5, Cycle 3 (2019) dataset, updated April 2021 version. It has Total respondents: 5,438, Complete responses: 5,247, Partial responses: 191. The survey collects nationally representative data routinely about the American public's use of cancer-related information. It is a large dataset with several identifible variables. As per the research question, several variables can be viewed as an output variable that could be predicted from other variable.

Finally, several items in HINTS have a specific focus on cancer prevention and control. <br>\n",
    " - The dataset has 5438 rows and 730 columns(variables).<br>\n",
    " - The data types include : category(368), float64(360), object(2). <br>\n",
    " - The key variables are key variables explicitly specified. I did not find any varibale can be eactly derivable from other varibale. Each question in the survey interview is a unique question. <br>\n",
    " - There are no redundant data variables. Nationally representative HINTS data are free to download and analyze.<br>\n",
    " - The dataset contains variables that could in principle be statistically predicted from other variables.It depends on the research question. For example : a) multivariable logistic regression models can be fitted to estimate predictors of achieving health goals with the help of smartphone or tablet and sending or receiving an SMS text message to or from a health care provider. b) ordinal logistic regression models can be used identify predictors of high trust in doctors and the internet separately for cancer-seeking information. c) Additionally, subgroup-specific analyses of HINTS data can be used to inform tailored cancer control planning efforts (e.g., by gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, cancer history).The dataset can be used to determine which individual health behaviors (e.g., fruit consumption, physical activity, and sleep) are associated with psychological health among cancer survivors and 2) determine if the number of health behaviors engaged in is associated with better psychological health among cancer survivors. <br>\n",
    " - HINTS data are available in SAS, SPSS, and STATA formats. It is not available in standard formats like csv, json, xml. I converted the spss file to csv using the above mentioned code. <br> "

The survey has comprehensive documentation(survey instrument,data files, codebooks, design documents, methodology, and more) for public use.In order to help cultivate a community of HINTS users, the organization has asked to let them know about published HINTS-related articles so that these can be posted on the HINTS Web site.\n",

Thus, iterations can be merged together to look at patterns over time and yield larger sample size. "

    " - Half of the participants were married.\n",
    " - Around 66% of the participants had education more than 12 years or completed high school.\n",
    " - 82% of the participants were never diagnosed with any kind of cancer. The data regarding the diagnosis of cancer is unbalanced. \n",
    " - About 43% of the participants were told that they have high BP/hypertension. This subset of the population can be considered to have high BP. Since the data isnt skewed for this parameter we can assess predictors or classify the behaviours of those who have high BP v/s who doesnt have high BP using other parameters such as physical activity, diet and online information seeking.\n",
    " - The federal guidelines recommend that adults eat at least 1½ to 2 cups per day. Interestingly 69% of the sample was meeting this recommendation.\n",
    " - From the barplot of blood pressure diagnosis and fruit intake we can see that the intake of fruits were more who did not get diagnosed with high BP. Further analysis can be done to find the correlations. The same can be done with those who were diagnosed with cancer or not. \n",
    " - 37% of the participants have at least smoked 100 cigarettes in your entire life."

    " - The organization states that the dataset was updated in March 2021 after it was discovered that 35 variables were affected by coding errors associated with missing values for data from participants who completed the survey online as part of the push-to-web pilot study. For some of the open-ended questions in the survey, invalid skips (-9) were coded to 0 instead of -9, and other related, derived variables required minor revisions to missing value assignments."

    " - The missing data such as TG1_FINWT1 is the sampling weights of only the paper based records. This is a parameter not asked in the questionnaire, so therefore for now I believe it is not necessary to focus on it. the data set has been cleaned and pre-processed by the organization. All other important parameters does not contain any null value. In the dataset the missing values/ uncertainities and errors are coded for example as we saw in the maritalstatus. We can drop the rows of the missing/uncertains values if the missing values are completely at random if we do an advanced data analysis. \n",
    " - Since most of the variables which have missing values are categorical, we can’t use mean or median but we can impute the Most Frequent Value to fill in the missing variables. "
