I'm supposed to present in lab meeting in less than an hour, and I haven't been able to get the simplest thing to work!\" After you help them calm down, they explain: through a collaboration with a fitness app, they have a 4GB file of high-precision weights of exactly 500 million people throughout the world. Even with 8GB of RAM, they get a MemoryError when trying to load the file in and find the average weight. They show you their code which worked fine when they tested it on a small number of weights:"

    " - Pay special attention to any large or nested loops, along with any time you are loading large datasets into your program in one fell swoop.In these cases, the best practice is often to break the work into batches, allowing the memory to be freed in between calls.<br>\n",
    " - Instead of using list to store all the data, we can define a variable sum (total weight) and a variable count to count the number of data. For each 'for loop', each line of data is added into variable sum, and the variable count increase by one and then the average can be calculated by sum divide by count(sum/count)."
